</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">I could not say at which station the woman and her
baby entered the train.</p>
<p>Since we had left London I had been engrossed in Henri
Bergson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Time and Free Will,&rdquo; as it is called in
the English translation. I had been conscious of various stoppages and
changes of passengers, but my attention had been held by
Bergson&rsquo;s argument. I agreed with his conclusion in advance, but
I wished to master his reasoning.</p>
<p>I looked up when the woman entered my compartment, though I did not
notice the name of the station. I caught sight of the baby she was
carrying, and turned back to my book. I thought the child was a freak,
an abnormality; and such things disgust me.</p>
<p>I returned to the study of my Bergson and read: &ldquo;It is at the
great and solemn crisis, decisive <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb4"
href="#pb4" name="pb4">4</a>]</span>of our reputation with others, that
we choose in defiance of what is conventionally called a motive, and
this absence of any tangible reason is the more striking the deeper our
freedom goes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I kept my eyes on the book&mdash;the train had started
again&mdash;but the next passage conveyed no meaning to my mind, and as
I attempted to re-read it an impression was interposed between me and
the work I was studying.</p>
<p>I saw projected on the page before me an image which I mistook at
first for the likeness of Richard Owen. It was the conformation of the
head that gave rise to the mistake, a head domed and massive, white and
smooth&mdash;it was a head that had always interested me. But as I
looked, my mind already searching for the reason of this hallucination,
I saw that the lower part of the face was that of an infant. My eyes
wandered from the book, and my gaze fluttered along the four persons
seated opposite to me, till they rested on the reality of my vision.
Even as these acts were being performed, I found myself foolishly
saying, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t call this freedom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For several seconds the eyes of the infant held mine. Its gaze was
steady and clear as that of a normal child, but what differentiated it
was the impression one received of calm intelligence. The head was
completely bald, and there was no trace <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb5" href="#pb5" name="pb5">5</a>]</span>of eyebrows, but the eyes
themselves were protected by thick, short lashes.</p>
<p>The child turned its head, and I felt my muscles relax. Until then I
had not been conscious that they had been stiffened. My gaze was
released, pushed aside as it were, and I found myself watching the
object of the child&rsquo;s next scrutiny.</p>
<p>This object was a man of forty or so, inclined to corpulence, and
untidy. He bore the evidences of failure in the process of becoming. He
wore a beard that was scanty and ragged, there were bare patches of
skin on the jaw; one inferred that he wore that beard only to save the
trouble of shaving. He was sitting next to me, the middle passenger of
the three on my side of the carriage, and he was absorbed in the pages
of a half-penny paper&mdash;I think he was reading the Police
News&mdash;which was interposed between him and the child in the corner
diagonally opposite to that which I occupied.</p>
<p>The man was hunched up, slouching, his legs crossed, his elbows
seeking support against his body; he held with both hands his paper,
unfolded, close to his eyes. He had the appearance of being very
myopic, but he did not wear glasses.</p>
<p>As I watched him, he began to fidget. He uncrossed his legs and
hunched his body deeper into the back of his seat. Presently his eyes
began <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb6" href="#pb6" name=
"pb6">6</a>]</span>to creep up the paper in front of him. When they
reached the top, he hesitated a moment, making a survey under cover,
then he dropped his hands and stared stupidly at the infant in the
corner, his mouth slightly open, his feet pulled in under the seat of
the carriage.</p>
<p>As the child let him go, his head drooped, and then he turned and
looked at me with a silly, vacuous smile. I looked away hurriedly; this
was not a man with whom I cared to share experience.</p>
<p>The process was repeated. The next victim was a big, rubicund,
healthy-looking man, clean shaved, with light-blue eyes that were
slightly magnified by the glasses of his gold-mounted spectacles. He,
too, had been reading a newspaper&mdash;the <i>Evening
Standard</i>&mdash;until the child&rsquo;s gaze claimed his attention,
and he, too, was held motionless by that strange, appraising stare. But
when he was released, his surprise found vent in words.
&ldquo;This,&rdquo; I thought, &ldquo;is the man accustomed to
act.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very remarkable child, ma&rsquo;am&rdquo; he said,
addressing the thin, ascetic-looking mother.</p>

<p class="first">The mother&rsquo;s appearance did not convey the
impression of poverty. She was, indeed, warmly, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb7" href="#pb7" name="pb7">7</a>]</span>decently,
and becomingly clad. She wore a long black coat, braided and frogged;
it had the air of belonging to an older fashion, but the material of it
was new. And her bonnet, trimmed with jet ornaments growing on stalks
that waved tremulously&mdash;that, also, was a modern replica of an
older mode. On her hands were black thread gloves, somewhat
ill-fitting.</p>
<p>Her face was not that of a country woman. The thin, high-bridged
nose, the fallen cheeks, the shadows under eyes gloomy and
retrospective&mdash;these were marks of the town; above all, perhaps,
that sallow greyness of the skin which speaks of
confinement&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>The child looked healthy enough. Its great bald head shone
resplendently like a globe of alabaster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very remarkable child, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said the
rubicund man who sat facing the woman.</p>
<p>The woman twitched her untidy-looking black eyebrows, her head
trembled slightly and set the jet fruit of her bonnet dancing and
nodding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very remarkable,&rdquo; said the man, adjusting his
spectacles and leaning forward. His action had an air of deliberate
courage; he was justifying his fortitude after that temporary
aberration.</p>
<p>I watched him a little nervously. I remembered <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8" name="pb8">8</a>]</span>my feelings
when, as a child, I had seen some magnificent enter the lion&rsquo;s
den in a travelling circus. The failure on my right was, also, absorbed
in the spectacle; he stared, open-mouthed, his eyes blinking and
shifting.</p>
<p>The other three occupants of the compartment, sitting on the same
side as the woman, back to the engine, dropped papers and magazines and
turned their heads, all interest. None of these three had, so far as I
had observed, fallen under the spell of inspection by the infant, but I
noticed that the man&mdash;an artisan apparently&mdash;who sat next to
the woman had edged away from her, and that the three passengers
opposite to me were huddled towards my end of the compartment.</p>
<p>The child had abstracted its gaze, which was now directed down the
aisle of the carriage, indefinitely focussed on some point outside the
window. It seemed remote, entirely unconcerned with any human
being.</p>
<p>I speak of it asexually. I was still uncertain as to its sex. It is
true that all babies look alike to me; but I should have known that
this child was male, the conformation of the skull alone should have
told me that. It was its dress that gave me cause to hesitate. It was
dressed absurdly, not in &ldquo;long-clothes,&rdquo; but in a long
frock that hid its feet and was bunched about its body. <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;Er&mdash;does it&mdash;er&mdash;can
it&mdash;talk?&rdquo; hesitated the rubicund man, and I grew hot at his
boldness. There seemed to be something disrespectful in speaking before
the child in this impersonal way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, he&rsquo;s never made a sound,&rdquo; replied the
woman, twitching and vibrating. Her heavy, dark eyebrows jerked
spasmodically, nervously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never cried?&rdquo; persisted the interrogator.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never once, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dumb, eh?&rdquo; He said it as an aside, half under his
breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;E&rsquo;s never spoke, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hm!&rdquo; The man cleared his throat and braced himself with
a deliberate and obvious effort. &ldquo;Is it&mdash;he&mdash;not water
on the brain&mdash;what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I felt that a rigour of breathless suspense held every occupant of
the compartment. I wanted, and I know that every other person there
wanted, to say, &ldquo;Look out! Don&rsquo;t go too far.&rdquo; The
child, however, seemed unconscious of the insult: he still stared out
through the window, lost in profound contemplation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, oh no!&rdquo; replied the woman.
&ldquo;&rsquo;E&rsquo;s got more sense than a ordinary child.&rdquo;
She held the infant as if it were some priceless piece of earthenware,
not nursing it as a woman nurses a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb10"
href="#pb10" name="pb10">10</a>]</span>baby, but balancing it with
supreme attention in her lap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How old is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>We had been awaiting this question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A year and nine munse, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ought to have spoken before that, oughtn&rsquo;t
he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never even cried, sir,&rdquo; said the woman. She regarded
the child with a look into which I read something of apprehension. If
it were apprehension it was a feeling that we all shared. But the
rubicund man was magnificent, though, like the lion tamer of my
youthful experience, he was doubtless conscious of the aspect his
temerity wore in the eyes of beholders. He must have been showing
off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you taken opinion?&rdquo; he asked; and then, seeing the
woman&rsquo;s lack of comprehension, he translated the
question&mdash;badly, for he conveyed a different
meaning&mdash;thus,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean, have you had a doctor for him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The train was slackening speed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what do <i>they</i> say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The child turned its head and looked the rubicund man full in the
eyes. Never in the face of any man or woman have I seen such an
expression of sublime pity and contempt&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>I remembered a small urchin I had once seen at <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href="#pb11" name="pb11">11</a>]</span>the
Zoological Gardens. Urged on by a band of other urchins, he was
throwing pebbles at a great lion that lolled, finely indifferent, on
the floor of its playground. Closer crept the urchin; he grew
splendidly bold; he threw larger and larger pebbles, until the lion
rose suddenly with a roar, and dashed fiercely down to the bars of its
cage.</p>
<p>I thought of that urchin&rsquo;s scared, shrieking face now, as the
rubicund man leant quickly back into his corner.</p>
<p>Yet that was not all, for the infant, satisfied, perhaps, with its
victim&rsquo;s ignominy, turned and looked at me with a cynical smile.
I was, as it were, taken into its confidence. I felt flattered,
undeservedly yet enormously flattered. I blushed, I may have
simpered.</p>
<p>The train drew up in Great Hittenden station.</p>
<p>The woman gathered her priceless possession carefully into her arms,
and the rubicund man adroitly opened the door for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good day, sir,&rdquo; she said, as she got out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good day,&rdquo; echoed the rubicund man with relief, and we
all drew a deep breath of relief with him in concert, as though we had
just witnessed the safe descent of some over-daring aviator.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">As the train moved on, we six, who had been
fellow-passengers for some thirty or forty minutes before the woman had
entered our compartment, we who had not till then exchanged a word,
broke suddenly into general conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Water on the brain; I don&rsquo;t care what any one
says,&rdquo; asserted the rubicund man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My sister had one very similar&rdquo;, put in the failure,
who was sitting next to me. &ldquo;It died,&rdquo; he added, by way of
giving point to his instance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ought not to exhibit freaks like that in public,&rdquo; said
an old man opposite to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, sir,&rdquo; was the verdict of the
artisan, and he spat carefully and scraped his boot on the floor;
&ldquo;them things ought to be kep&rsquo; private.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mad, of course, that&rsquo;s to say imbecile&rdquo;, repeated
the rubicund man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Horrid head he&rsquo;d got,&rdquo; said the failure, and
shivered histrionically.</p>
<p>They continued to demonstrate their contempt for the infant by many
asseverations. The reaction grew. They were all bold now and all wanted
to speak. They spoke as the survivors from some common peril; they were
increasingly anxious to demonstrate that they had never suffered
intimidation and in their relief they were anxious to laugh
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href="#pb13" name=
"pb13">13</a>]</span>at the thing which had for a time subdued them.
But they never named it as a cause for fear. Their speech was merely
innuendo.</p>
<p>At the last, however, I caught an echo of the true feeling.</p>
<p>It was the rubicund man, who, most daring during the crisis was now
bold enough to admit curiosity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your opinion, sir?&rdquo; he said to me. The
train was running into Wenderby; he was preparing to get out; and he
leaned forward, his fingers on the handle of the door.</p>
<p>I was embarrassed. Why had I been singled out by the child? I had
taken no part in the recent interjectory conversation. Was this a
consequence of the notice that had been paid to me?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I?&rdquo; I stammered and then reverted to the rubicund
man&rsquo;s original phrase, &ldquo;It&mdash;it was certainly a very
remarkable child,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>The rubicund man nodded and pursed his lips. &ldquo;Very,&rdquo; he
muttered as he alighted, &ldquo;Very remarkable. Well, good day to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I returned to my book and was surprised to find that my index finger
was still marking the place at which I had been interrupted some
fifteen minutes before. My arm felt stiff and cramped.</p>
<p>I read &ldquo;&hellip; this absence of any tangible reason is the
more striking the deeper our freedom goes.&rdquo; <span class=

<h2 class="main">NOTES FOR A BIOGRAPHY OF GINGER STOTT</h2>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">I</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Ginger Stott is a name that was once as well known as
any in England. Stott has been the subject of leading articles in every
daily paper; his life has been written by an able journalist who
interviewed Stott himself, during ten crowded minutes, and filled three
hundred pages with details, seventy per cent. of which were taken from
the journals, and the remainder supplied by a brilliant imagination.
Ten years ago Ginger Stott was on a pinnacle, there was a Stott vogue.
You found his name at the bottom of signed articles written by members
of the editorial staff; you bought Stott collars, although Stott
himself did not wear collars; there was a Stott waltz which is
occasionally hummed by clerks, and whistled by errand-boys to this day;
there was a periodical which lived for ten months, entitled <i>Ginger
Stott&rsquo;s Weekly</i>; in brief, during one summer there was a Stott
apotheosis. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15" name=
"pb15">15</a>]</span></p>
<p>But that was ten years ago, and the rising generation has almost
forgotten the once well-known name. One rarely sees him mentioned in
the morning paper now, and then it is but the briefest reference; some
such note as this &ldquo;Pickering was at the top of his form,
recalling the finest achievements of Ginger Stott at his best,&rdquo;
or &ldquo;Flack is a magnificent find for Kent: he promises to
completely surpass the historic feats of Ginger Stott.&rdquo; These
journalistic superlatives only irritate those who remember the
performances referred to. We who watched the man&rsquo;s career know
that Pickering and Flack are but tyros compared to Stott; we know that
none of his successors has challenged comparison with him. He was a
meteor that blazed across the sky, and if he ever has a true successor,
such stars as Pickering and Flack will shine pale and dim in
comparison.</p>
<p>It makes one feel suddenly old to recall that great matin&eacute;e
at the Lyceum, given for Ginger Stott&rsquo;s benefit after he met with
his accident. In ten years so many great figures in that world have
died or fallen into obscurity. I can count on my fingers the number of
those who were then, and are still, in the forefront of popularity. Of
the others poor Captain Wallis, for instance, is dead&mdash;and no
modern writer, in my opinion, can equal the brilliant descriptiveness
of Wallis&rsquo;s articles in the <i>Daily Post</i>. Bobby Maisefield,
again, Stott&rsquo;s colleague, is a <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb16" href="#pb16" name="pb16">16</a>]</span>martyr to rheumatism, and
keeps a shop in Ailesworth, the scene of so many of his triumphs. What
a list one might make, but how uselessly. It is enough to note how many
names have dropped out, how many others are the names of those we now
speak of as veterans. In ten years! It certainly makes one feel
old.</p>

<p class="first">No apology is needed for telling again the story of
Stott&rsquo;s career. Certain details will still be familiar, it is
true, the historic details that can never be forgotten while cricket
holds place as our national game. But there are many facts of
Stott&rsquo;s life familiar to me, which have never been made public
property. If I must repeat that which is known, I can give the known a
new setting; perhaps a new value.</p>
<p>He came of mixed races. His mother was pure Welsh, his father a
Yorkshire collier; but when Ginger was nine years old his father died,
and Mrs. Stott came to live in Ailesworth where she had immigrant
relations, and it was there that she set up the little paper-shop, the
business by which she maintained herself and her boy. That shop is
still in existence, and the name has not been altered. You may find it
in the little street <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17"
name="pb17">17</a>]</span>that runs off the market place, going down
towards the Borstal Institution.</p>
<p>There are many people alive in Ailesworth today who can remember the
sturdy, freckled, sandy-haired boy who used to go round with the
morning and evening papers; the boy who was to change the fortunes of a
county.</p>
<p>Ginger was phenomenally thorough in all he undertook. It was one of
the secrets of his success. It was this thoroughness that kept him
engaged in his mother&rsquo;s little business until he was seventeen.
Up to that age he never found time for cricket&mdash;he certainly had
remarkable and very unusual qualities.</p>
<p>It was sheer chance, apparently, that determined his choice of a
career.</p>
<p>He had walked into Stoke-Underhill to deliver a parcel, and on his
way back his attention was arrested by the sight of a line of vehicles
drawn up to the boarded fencing that encloses the Ailesworth County
Ground. The occupants of these vehicles were standing up, struggling to
catch a sight of the match that was being played behind the screen
erected to shut out non-paying sightseers. Among the horses&rsquo;
feet, squirming between the spokes of wheels, utterly regardless of all
injury, small boys glued their eyes to knot-holes in the fence, while
others climbed surreptitiously, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb18"
href="#pb18" name="pb18">18</a>]</span>for the most part unobserved, on
to the backs of tradesmen&rsquo;s carts. All these individuals were in
a state of tremendous excitement, and even the policeman whose duty it
was to move them on, was so engrossed in watching the game that he had
disappeared inside the turnstile, and had given the outside spectators
full opportunity for eleemosynary enjoyment.</p>
<p>That tarred fence has since been raised some six feet, and now
encloses a wider sweep of ground&mdash;alterations that may be classed
among the minor revolutions effected by the genius of that thick-set,
fair-haired youth of seventeen, who paused on that early September
afternoon to wonder what all the fuss was about. The Ailesworth County
Ground was not famous in those days; not then was accommodation needed
for thirty thousand spectators, drawn from every county in England to
witness the unparalleled.</p>
<p>Ginger stopped. The interest of the spectacle pierced his absorption
in the business he had in hand. Such a thing was almost
unprecedented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; he asked of Puggy Phillips.</p>
<p>Puggy Phillips&mdash;hazarding his life by standing on the shiny,
slightly curved top of his butcher&rsquo;s cart&mdash;made no
appropriate answer. &ldquo;Yah&mdash;<i>ah</i>&mdash;<span class=
"sc">AH</span>!&rdquo; he screamed in ecstasy. &ldquo;Oh! played!
Pla-a-a-ayed!!&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19"
name="pb19">19</a>]</span></p>
<p>Ginger wasted no more breath, but laid hold of the little brass rail
that encircled Puggy&rsquo;s platform, and with a sudden hoist that
lifted the shafts and startled the pony, raised himself to the level of
a spectator.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ere!&rdquo; shouted the swaying, tottering Puggy,
&ldquo;What the &hellip; are yer rup to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The well-drilled pony, however, settled down again quietly to
maintain his end of the see-saw, and, finding himself still able to
preserve his equilibrium, Puggy instantly forgot the presence of the
intruder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; asked Ginger again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Well <i>&rsquo;it</i>, <span class="sc">WELL
&rsquo;IT</span>!&rdquo; yelled Puggy. &ldquo;Oh! Gow on, gow on agen!
Run it <i>aht</i>. Run it <span class="sc">AH-T</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ginger gave it up, and turned his attention to the match.</p>
<p>It was not any famous struggle that was being fought out on the old
Ailesworth Ground; it was only second-class cricket, the deciding match
of the Minor Counties championship. Hampdenshire and Oxfordshire, old
rivals, had been neck-and-neck all through the season, and, as luck
would have it, the engagement between them had been the last fixture on
the card.</p>
<p>When Ginger rose to the level of spectator, the match was
anybody&rsquo;s game. Bobby Maisefield <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb20" href="#pb20" name="pb20">20</a>]</span>was batting. He was then
a promising young colt who had not earned a fixed place in the Eleven.
Ginger knew him socially, but they were not friends, they had no
interests in common. Bobby had made twenty-seven. He was partnered by
old Trigson, the bowler, (he has been dead these eight years,) whose
characteristic score of &ldquo;Not out &hellip; O,&rdquo; is
sufficiently representative of his methods.</p>
<p>It was the fourth innings, and Hampdenshire with only one more
wicket to fall, still required nineteen runs to win. Trigson could be
relied upon to keep his wicket up, but not to score. The hopes of
Ailesworth centred in the ability of that almost untried colt Bobby
Maisefield&mdash;and he seemed likely to justify the trust reposed in
him. A beautiful late cut that eluded third man and hit the fence with
a resounding bang, nearly drove Puggy wild with delight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only fifteen more,&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Oh! Played;
pla-a-a-yed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But as the score crept up, the tensity grew. As each ball was
delivered, a chill, rigid silence held the onlookers in its grip. When
Trigson, with the field collected round him, almost to be covered with
a sheet, stonewalled the most tempting lob, the click of the ball on
his bat was an intrusion on the stillness. And always it was followed
by a deep breath of relief that sighed round the ring <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="#pb21" name="pb21">21</a>]</span>like a
faint wind through a plantation of larches. When Bobby scored, the
tumult broke out like a crash of thunder; but it subsided again,
echoless, to that intense silence so soon as the ball was
&ldquo;dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Curiously, it was not Bobby who made the winning hit but Trigson.
&ldquo;One to tie, two to win,&rdquo; breathed Puggy as the field
changed over, and it was Trigson who had to face the bowling. The
suspense was torture. Oxford had put on their fast bowler again, and
Trigson, intimidated, perhaps, did not play him with quite so straight
a bat as he had opposed to the lob-bowler. The ball hit Trigson&rsquo;s
bat and glanced through the slips. The field was very close to the
wicket, and the ball was travelling fast. No one seemed to make any
attempt to stop it. For a moment the significance of the thing was not
realised; for a moment only, then followed uproar, deafening,
stupendous.</p>
<p>Puggy was stamping fiercely on the top of his cart; the tears were
streaming down his face; he was screaming and yelling incoherent words.
He was representative of the crowd. Thus men shouted and stamped and
cried when news came of the relief of Kimberley, or when that false
report of victory was brought to Paris in the August of
1870&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>The effect upon Ginger was a thing apart. He did not join in the
fierce acclamation; he did not <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb22"
href="#pb22" name="pb22">22</a>]</span>wait to see the chairing of
Bobby and Trigson. The greatness of Stott&rsquo;s character, the
fineness of his genius is displayed in his attitude towards the
dramatic spectacle he had just witnessed.</p>
<p>As he trudged home into Ailesworth, his thoughts found vent in a
muttered sentence which is peculiarly typical of the effect that had
been made upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe I could have bowled that chap,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In writing a history of this kind, a certain licence
must be claimed. It will be understood that I am filling certain gaps
in the narrative with imagined detail. But the facts are true. My added
detail is only intended to give an appearance of life and reality to my
history. Let me, therefore, insist upon one vital point. I have not
been dependent on hearsay for one single fact in this story. Where my
experience does not depend upon personal experience, it has been
received from the principals themselves. Finally, it should be
remembered that when I have, imaginatively, put words into the mouths
of the persons of this story, they are never essential words which
affect the issue. The essential speeches are reported from first-hand
sources. For instance, Ginger Stott himself has told me on more than
one occasion that the words <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href=
"#pb23" name="pb23">23</a>]</span>with which I closed the last section,
were the actual words spoken by him on the occasion in question. It was
not until six years after the great Oxfordshire match that I myself
first met the man, but what follows is literally true in all
essentials.</p>
<p>There was a long, narrow strip of yard, or alley, at the back of
Mrs. Stott&rsquo;s paper-shop, a yard that, unfortunately, no longer
exists. It has been partly built over, and another of England&rsquo;s
memorials has thus been destroyed by the vandals of modern
commerce&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>This yard was fifty-three feet long, measuring from Mrs.
Stott&rsquo;s back door to the door of the coal-shed, which marked the
alley&rsquo;s extreme limit. This measurement, an apparently negligible
trifle, had an important effect upon Stott&rsquo;s career. For it was
in this yard that he taught himself to bowl, and the shortness of the
pitch precluded his taking any run. From those long studious hours of
practice he emerged with a characteristic that was&mdash;and still
remains&mdash;unique. Stott never took more than two steps before
delivering the ball; frequently he bowled from a standing position, and
batsmen have confessed that of all Stott&rsquo;s puzzling mannerisms,
this was the one to which they never became accustomed. S. R. L.
Maturin, the finest bat Australia ever sent to this country, has told
me that to this <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href="#pb24" name=
"pb24">24</a>]</span>peculiarity of delivery he attributed his failure
ever to score freely against Stott. It completely upset one&rsquo;s
habit of play, he said: one had no time to prepare for the flight of
the ball; it came at one so suddenly. Other bowlers have since
attempted some imitation of this method without success. They had not
Stott&rsquo;s physical advantages.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the shortness of that alley threw Stott back for two
years. When he first emerged to try conclusions on the field, he found
his length on the longer pitch utterly unreliable, and the effort
necessary to throw the ball another six yards, at first upset his
slowly acquired methods.</p>
<p>It was not until he was twenty years old that Ginger Stott played in
his first Colts&rsquo; match.</p>
<p>The three years that had intervened had not been prosperous years
for Hampdenshire. Their team was a one-man team. Bobby Maisefield was
developing into a fine bat (and other counties were throwing out
inducements to him, trying to persuade him to qualify for first-class
cricket), but he found no support, and Hampdenshire was never looked
upon as a coming county. The best of the minor counties in those years
were Staffordshire and Norfolk.</p>
<p>In the Colts&rsquo; match Stott&rsquo;s analysis ran:</p>
<div class="table">
<table class="xd26e728">
<tr>
<td class="cellLeft cellTop">overs</td>
<td class="cellTop">maidens</td>
<td class="cellTop">runs</td>
<td class="cellRight cellTop">wickets</td>

<tr>
<td class="cellLeft cellBottom">11.3</td>
<td class="cellBottom">7</td>
<td class="cellBottom">16</td>
<td class="cellRight cellBottom">7</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<p>and reference to the score-sheet, which is still preserved
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25" name=
"pb25">25</a>]</span>among the records of the County Club, shows that
six of the seven wickets were clean bowled. The Eleven had no second
innings; the match was drawn, owing to rain. Stott has told me that the
Eleven had to bat on a drying wicket, but after making all allowances,
the performance was certainly phenomenal.</p>
<p>After this match Stott was, of course, played regularly. That year
Hampdenshire rose once more to their old position at the head of the
minor counties, and Maisefield, who had been seriously considering
Surrey&rsquo;s offer of a place in their Eleven after two years&rsquo;
qualification by residence, decided to remain with the county which had
given him his first chance.</p>
<p>During that season Stott did not record any performance so
remarkable as his feat in the Colts&rsquo; match, but his record for
the year was eighty-seven wickets with an average of 9.31; and it is
worthy of notice that Yorkshire made overtures to him, as he was
qualified by birth to play for the northern county.</p>
<p>I think there must have been a wonderful <i lang="fr">esprit de
corps</i> among the members of that early Hampdenshire Eleven. There
are other evidences beside this refusal of its two most prominent
members to join the ranks of first-class cricket. Lord R&mdash;&mdash;,
the president of the H.C.C.C<span class="corr" id="xd26e762" title=
"Not in source">.</span>, has told me that this <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href="#pb26" name="pb26">26</a>]</span>spirit
was quite as marked as in the earlier case of Kent. He himself
certainly did much to promote it, and his generosity in making good the
deficits of the balance sheet, had a great influence on the
acceleration of Hampdenshire&rsquo;s triumph.</p>
<p>In his second year, though Hampdenshire were again champions of the
second-class counties, Stott had not such a fine average as in the
preceding season. Sixty-one wickets for eight hundred and sixty-eight
(average 14.23) seems to show a decline in his powers, but that was a
wonderful year for batsmen (Maisefield scored seven hundred and
forty-two runs, with an average of forty-two) and, moreover, that was
the year in which Stott was privately practising his new theory.</p>
<p>It was in this year that three very promising recruits, all since
become famous, joined the Eleven, viz.: P. H. Evans, St. John Townley,
and Flower the fast bowler. With these five cricketers Hampdenshire
fully deserved their elevation into the list of first-class counties.
Curiously enough, they took the place of the old champions,
Gloucestershire, who, with Somerset, fell back into the obscurity of
the second-class that season. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">I must turn aside for a moment at this point in order
to explain the &ldquo;new theory&rdquo; of Stott&rsquo;s, to which I
have referred, a theory which became in practice one of the elements of
his most astounding successes.</p>
<p>Ginger Stott was not a tall man. He stood only 5 ft. 5&frac14; in.
in his socks, but he was tremendously solid; he had what is known as a
&ldquo;stocky&rdquo; figure, broad and deep-chested. That was where his
muscular power lay, for his abnormally long arms were rather thin,
though his huge hands were powerful enough.</p>
<p>Even without his &ldquo;new theory,&rdquo; Stott would have been an
exceptional bowler. His thoroughness would have assured his success. He
studied his art diligently, and practised regularly in a barn through
the winter. His physique, too, was a magnificent instrument. That long,
muscular body was superbly steady on the short, thick legs. It gave him
a fulcrum, firm, apparently immovable. And those weirdly long, thin
arms could move with lightning rapidity. He always stood with his hands
behind him, and then&mdash;as often as not without even one preliminary
step&mdash;the long arm would flash round and the ball be delivered,
without giving the batsman any opportunity of watching his hand; you
could <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28" name=
"pb28">28</a>]</span>never tell which way he was going to break. It was
astonishing, too, the pace he could get without any run. Poor Wallis
used to call him the &ldquo;human catapult&rdquo;; Wallis was always
trying to find new phrases.</p>
<p>The theory first came to Stott when he was practising at the nets.
It was a windy morning, and he noticed that several times the balls he
bowled swerved in the air. When those swerving balls came they were
almost unplayable.</p>
<p>Stott made no remark to any one&mdash;he was bowling to the
groundsman&mdash;but the ambition to bowl &ldquo;swerves,&rdquo; as
they were afterwards called, took possession of him from that morning.
It is true that he never mastered the theory completely; on a perfectly
calm day he could never depend upon obtaining any swerve at all, but,
within limits, he developed his theory until he had any batsman
practically at his mercy.</p>
<p>He might have mastered the theory completely, had it not been for
his accident&mdash;we must remember that he had only three seasons of
first-class cricket&mdash;and, personally, I believe he would have
achieved that complete mastery. But I do not believe, as Stott did,
that he could have taught his method to another man. That belief became
an obsession with him, and will be dealt with later.</p>
<p>My own reasons for doubting that Stott&rsquo;s <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29" name=
"pb29">29</a>]</span>&ldquo;swerve&rdquo; could have been taught, is
that it would have been necessary for the pupil to have had
Stott&rsquo;s peculiarities, not only of method, but of physique. He
used to spin the ball with a twist of his middle finger and
thumb,&mdash;just as you may see a billiard professional spin a
billiard ball. To do this in his manner, it is absolutely necessary not
only to have a very large and muscular hand, but to have very lithe and
flexible arm muscles, for the arm is moving rapidly while the twist is
given, and there must be no antagonistic muscular action. Further, I
believe that part of the secret was due to the fact that Stott bowled
from a standing position. Given these things, the rest is merely a
question of long and assiduous practice. The human mechanism is
marvellously adaptable. I have seen Stott throw a cricket ball half
across the room with sufficient spin on the ball to make it shoot back
to him along the carpet.</p>
<p>I have mentioned the wind as a factor in obtaining the swerve. It
was a head-wind that Stott required. I have seen him, for sport, toss a
cricket ball into the teeth of a gale, and make it describe the
trajectory of a badly sliced golf-ball. This is why the big pavilion at
Ailesworth is set at such a curious angle to the ground. It was built
in the winter following Hampdenshire&rsquo;s second season of
first-class cricket, and it was so placed that when the wickets were
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30" name=
"pb30">30</a>]</span>pitched in a line with it, they might lie
south-west and north-east, or in the direction of the prevailing
winds.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The first time I ever saw Ginger Stott, was on the
occasion of the historic encounter with Surrey; Hampdenshire&rsquo;s
second engagement in first-class cricket. The match with Notts, played
at Trent Bridge a few days earlier, had not foreshadowed any startling
results. The truth of the matter is that Stott had been kept,
deliberately, in the background; and as matters turned out his services
were only required to finish off Notts&rsquo; second innings. Stott was
even then a marked man, and the Hampdenshire captain did not wish to
advertise his methods too freely before the Surrey match. Neither
Archie Findlater, who was captaining the team that year, nor any other
person, had the least conception of how unnecessary such a reservation
was to prove. In his third year, when Stott had been studied by every
English, Australian, and South African batsman of any note, he was
still as unplayable as when he made his d&eacute;but in first-class
cricket.</p>
<p>I was reporting the Surrey match for two papers, and in company with
poor Wallis interviewed Stott before the first innings.</p>
<p>His appearance made a great impression on me. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name="pb31">31</a>]</span>I have,
of course, met him, and talked with him many times since then, but my
most vivid memory of him is the picture recorded in the inadequate
professional dressing-room of the old Ailesworth pavilion.</p>
<p>I have turned up the account of my interview in an old press-cutting
book, and I do not know that I can do better than quote that part of it
which describes Stott&rsquo;s personal appearance. I wrote the account
on the off chance of being able to get it taken. It was one of my lucky
hits. After that match, finished in a single day, my interview afforded
copy that any paper would have paid heavily for, and gladly.</p>
<p>Here is the description:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Stott&mdash;he is known to every one in
Ailesworth as &lsquo;Ginger&rsquo; Stott&mdash;is a short, thick-set
young man, with abnormally long arms that are tanned a rich red up to
the elbow. The tan does not, however, obliterate the golden freckles
with which arm and face are richly speckled. There is no need to
speculate as to the <i lang="fr">raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</i> of his
nickname. The hair of his head, a close, short crop, is a pale russet,
and the hair on his hands and arms is a yellower shade of the same
colour. &lsquo;Ginger&rsquo; is, indeed, a perfectly apt description.
He has a square chin and a thin-lipped, determined mouth. His eyes are
a clear, but rather light blue, his forehead is good, broad, and high,
and he has a well-proportioned head. One might have put him down as
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32" name=
"pb32">32</a>]</span>an engineer, essentially intelligent, purposeful,
and reserved.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The description is journalistic, but I do not know that I could
improve upon the detail of it. I can see those queer, freckled, hairy
arms of his as I write&mdash;the combination of colours in them
produced an effect that was almost orange. It struck one as
unusual&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Surrey had the choice of innings, and decided to bat, despite the
fact that the wicket was drying after rain, under the influence of a
steady south-west wind and occasional bursts of sunshine. Would any
captain in Stott&rsquo;s second year have dared to take first innings
under such conditions? The question is farcical now, but not a single
member of the Hampdenshire Eleven had the least conception that the
Surrey captain was deliberately throwing away his chances on that
eventful day.</p>
<p>Wallis and I were sitting together in the reporters&rsquo; box.
There were only four of us; two specials,&mdash;Wallis and
myself,&mdash;a news-agency reporter, and a local man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stott takes first over,&rdquo; remarked Wallis, sharpening
his pencil and arranging his watch and score-sheet&mdash;he was very
meticulous in his methods. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve put him to bowl against
the wind. He&rsquo;s medium right, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t the least idea,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;He
volunteered <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33" name=
"pb33">33</a>]</span>no information; Hampdenshire have been keeping him
dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wallis sneered. &ldquo;Think they&rsquo;ve got a find, eh?&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll wait and see what he can do against
first-class batting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We did not have to wait long.</p>
<p>As usual, Thorpe and Harrison were first wicket for Surrey, and
Thorpe took the first ball.</p>
<p>It bowled him. It made his wicket look as untidy as any wicket I
have ever seen. The off stump was out of the ground, and the other two
were markedly divergent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn it, I wasn&rsquo;t ready for him,&rdquo; we heard Thorpe
say in the professionals&rsquo; room. Thorpe always had some excuse,
but on this occasion it was justified.</p>
<p>C. V. Punshon was the next comer, and he got his first ball through
the slips for four, but Wallis looked at me with a raised eyebrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Punshon didn&rsquo;t know a lot about that,&rdquo; he said,
and then he added, &ldquo;I say, what a queer delivery the chap has. He
stands and shoots &rsquo;em out. It&rsquo;s uncanny. He&rsquo;s a kind
of human catapult.&rdquo; He made a note of the phrase on his pad.</p>
<p>Punshon succeeded in hitting the next ball, also, but it simply ran
up his bat into the hands of short slip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s a sitter, if you like,&rdquo; said Wallis.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with &rsquo;em?&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34" name="pb34">34</a>]</span></p>
<p>I was beginning to grow enthusiastic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Wallis,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;this chap&rsquo;s
going to break records.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wallis was still doubtful.</p>
<p>He was convinced before the innings was over.</p>
<p>There must be many who remember the startling poster that heralded
the early editions of the evening papers:</p>
<p class="xd26e121">SURREY<br>
ALL OUT<br>
FOR 13 RUNS.</p>
<p>For once sub-editors did not hesitate to give the score on the
contents bill. That was a proclamation which would sell. Inside, the
headlines were rich and varied. I have an old paper by me, yellow now,
and brittle, that may serve as a type for the rest. The headlines are
as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p class="xd26e121">SURREY AND HAMPDENSHIRE.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p class="xd26e121">EXTRAORDINARY BOWLING PERFORMANCE.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p class="xd26e121">DOUBLE HAT-TRICK.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p class="xd26e121">SURREY ALL OUT IN 35 MINUTES FOR 13 RUNS.</p>

"pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35" name="pb35">35</a>]</span></p>
<p>The &ldquo;double hat-trick&rdquo; was six consecutive wickets, the
last six, all clean bowled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; Wallis said, when the last wicket fell, and
he looked at me with something like fear in his eyes. &ldquo;This man
will have to be barred; it means the end of cricket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I need not detail the remainder of the match. Hampdenshire hit up
ninety-three&mdash;P. H. Evans was top scorer with
twenty-seven&mdash;and then got Surrey out a second time for
forty-nine.</p>
<p>I believe Stott did not bowl his best in the second innings. He was
quite clever enough to see that he must not overdo it. As Wallis had
said, if he were too effective he might have to be barred. As it was,
he took seven wickets for twenty-three.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=
"#toc">Contents</a>]</span>
<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">VI</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">That was Stott&rsquo;s finest performance. On eight
subsequent occasions he took all ten wickets in a single innings, once
he took nineteen wickets in one match (Hampdenshire <i>v.</i> Somerset
at Taunton), twice he took five wickets with consecutive balls, and any
number of times he did the &ldquo;hat-trick,&rdquo; but he never
afterwards achieved so amazing a performance as that of the celebrated
Surrey match.</p>
<p>I am still of opinion that Stott deliberately bowled carelessly in
the second innings of that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href=
"#pb36" name="pb36">36</a>]</span>match, but, after watching him on
many fields, and after a careful analysis of his methods&mdash;and
character&mdash;I am quite certain that his comparative failures in
later matches were not due to any purpose on Stott&rsquo;s part.</p>
<p>Take, for instance, the match which Hampdenshire lost to Kent in
Stott&rsquo;s second season&mdash;their first loss as a first-class
county; their record up to that time was thirteen wins and six drawn
games. It is incredible to me that Stott should have deliberately
allowed Kent to make the necessary one hundred and eighty-seven runs
required in the fourth innings. He took five wickets for sixty-three;
if he could have done better, I am sure he would have made the effort.
He would not have sacrificed his county. I have spoken of the <i>esprit
de corps</i> which held the Hampdenshire Eleven together, and they were
notably proud of their unbeaten record.</p>
<p>No; we must find another reason for Stott&rsquo;s comparative
failures. I believe that I am the only person who knows that reason,
and I say that Stott was the victim of an obsession. His
&ldquo;swerve&rdquo; theory dominated him, he was always experimenting
with it, and when, as in the Kent match I have cited, the game was
played in a flat calm, his failure to influence the trajectory of the
ball in his own peculiar manner, puzzled and upset him. He would strive
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37" name=
"pb37">37</a>]</span>to make the ball swerve, and in the effort he lost
his length and became playable. Moreover, when Stott was hit he lost
his temper, and then he was useless. Findlater always took him off the
moment he showed signs of temper. The usual sign was a fast full pitch
at the batsman&rsquo;s ribs.</p>
<p>I have one more piece of evidence, the best possible, which upholds
this explanation of mine, but it must follow the account of
Stott&rsquo;s accident.</p>
<p>That accident came during the high flood of Hampdenshire success.
For two years they had held undisputed place as champion county, a
place which could not be upset by the most ingenious methods of
calculating points. They had three times defeated Australia, and were
playing four men in the test matches. As a team they were capable of
beating any Eleven opposed to them. Not even the newspaper critics
denied that.</p>
<p>In this third year of Hampdenshire&rsquo;s triumph, Australia had
sent over the finest eleven that had ever represented the colony, but
they had lost the first two test matches, and they had lost to
Hampdenshire. Nevertheless, they won the rubber, and took back the
&ldquo;ashes.&rdquo; No one has ever denied, I believe, that this was
due to Stott&rsquo;s accident. There is in this case no room for any
one to argue that the argument is based on the fallacy of <i>post</i>
and <i>propter</i>.</p>
<p>The accident appeared insignificant at the time. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38" name="pb38">38</a>]</span>The
match was against Notts on the Trent Bridge ground. I was reporting for
three papers; Wallis was not there.</p>
<p>Stott had been taken off. Notts were a poor lot that year and I
think Findlater did not wish to make their defeat appear too
ignominious. Flower was bowling; it was a fast, true wicket, and Stott,
who was a safe field, was at cover.</p>
<p>G. L. Mallinson was batting and making good use of his opportunity;
he was, it will be remembered, a magnificent though erratic hitter.
Flower bowled him a short-pitched, fast ball, rather wide of the
off-stump. Many men might have left it alone, for the ball was rising,
and the slips were crowded, but Mallinson timed the ball splendidly,
and drove it with all his force. He could not keep it on the ground,
however, and Stott had a possible chance. He leaped for it and just
touched the ball with his right hand. The ball jumped the ring at its
first bound, and Mallinson never even attempted to run. There was a big
round of applause from the Trent Bridge crowd.</p>
<p>I noticed that Stott had tied a handkerchief round his finger, but I
forgot the incident until I saw Findlater beckon to his best bowler, a
few overs later. Notts had made enough runs for decency; it was time to
get them out.</p>
<p>I saw Stott walk up to Findlater and shake his <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href="#pb39" name="pb39">39</a>]</span>head,
and through my glasses I saw him whip the handkerchief from his finger
and display his hand. Findlater frowned, said something and looked
towards the pavilion, but Stott shook his head. He evidently disagreed
with Findlater&rsquo;s proposal. Then Mallinson came up, and the great
bulk of his back hid the faces of the other two. The crowd was
beginning to grow excited at the interruption. Every one had guessed
that something was wrong. All round the ring men were standing up,
trying to make out what was going on.</p>
<p>I drew my inferences from Mallinson&rsquo;s face, for when he turned
round and strolled back to his wicket, he was wearing a broad smile.
Through my field glasses I could see that he was licking his lower lip
with his tongue. His shoulders were humped and his whole expression one
of barely controlled glee. (I always see that picture framed in a
circle; a bioscopic presentation.) He could hardly refrain from
dancing. Then little Beale, who was Mallinson&rsquo;s partner, came up
and spoke to him, and I saw Mallinson hug himself with delight as he
explained the situation.</p>
<p>When Stott unwillingly came into the pavilion, a low murmur ran
round the ring, like the buzz of a great crowd of disturbed blue flies.
In that murmur I could distinctly trace the signs of mixed feelings. No
doubt the crowd had come there to witness the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40" name=
"pb40">40</a>]</span>performances of the phenomenon&mdash;the abnormal
of every kind has a wonderful attraction for us&mdash;but, on the other
hand, the majority wanted to see their own county win. Moreover,
Mallinson was giving them a taste of his abnormal powers of hitting,
and the batsman appeals to the spectacular, more than the bowler.</p>
<p>I ran down hurriedly to meet Stott.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a split finger, sir,&rdquo; he said carelessly, in
answer to my question; &ldquo;but Mr. Findlater says I must see to
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I examined the finger, and it certainly did not seem to call for
surgical aid. Evidently it had been caught by the seam of the new ball;
there was a fairly clean cut about half an inch long on the fleshy
underside of the second joint of the middle finger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better have it seen to,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t
afford to lose you, you know, Stott.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stott gave a laugh that was more nearly a snarl. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t
the first time I&rsquo;ve &rsquo;ad a cut finger,&rdquo; he said
scornfully.</p>
<p>He had the finger bound up when I saw him again, but it had been
done by an amateur. I learnt afterwards that no antiseptic had been
used. That was at lunch time, and Notts had made a hundred and
sixty-eight for one wicket; Mallinson was not out, a hundred and three.
I saw that the Notts Eleven were in magnificent spirits. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href="#pb41" name="pb41">41</a>]</span></p>
<p>But after lunch Stott came out and took the first over. I
don&rsquo;t know what had passed between him and Findlater, but the
captain had evidently been over-persuaded.</p>
<p>We must not blame Findlater. The cut certainly appeared trifling, it
was not bad enough to prevent Stott from bowling, and Hampdenshire
seemed powerless on that wicket without him. It is very easy to
distribute blame after the event, but most people would have done what
Findlater did in those circumstances.</p>
<p>The cut did not appear to inconvenience Stott in the least degree.
He bowled Mallinson with his second ball, and the innings was finished
up in another fifty-seven minutes for the addition of thirty-eight
runs.</p>
<p>Hampdenshire made two hundred and thirty-seven for three wickets
before the drawing of stumps, and that was the end of the match, for
the weather changed during the night and rain prevented any further
play.</p>
<p>I, of course, stayed on in Nottingham to await results. I saw Stott
on the next day, Friday, and asked him about his finger. He made light
of it, but that evening Findlater told me over the bridge-table that he
was not happy about it. He had seen the finger, and thought it showed a
tendency to inflammation. &ldquo;I shall take him to Gregory in the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42" name=
"pb42">42</a>]</span>morning if it&rsquo;s not all right,&rdquo; he
said. Gregory was a well-known surgeon in Nottingham.</p>
<p>Again one sees, now, that the visit to Gregory should not have been
postponed, but at the time one does not take extraordinary precautions
in such a case as this. A split finger is such an everyday thing, and
one is guided by the average of experience. After all, if one were
constantly to make preparation for the abnormal, ordinary life could
not go on&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>I heard that Gregory pursed his lips over that finger when he had
learned the name of his famous patient. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to be
very careful of this, young man,&rdquo; was Findlater&rsquo;s report of
Gregory&rsquo;s advice. It was not sufficient. I often wonder now
whether Gregory might not have saved the finger. If he had performed
some small operation at once, cut away the poison, it seems to me that
the tragedy might have been averted. I am, I admit, a mere layman in
these matters, but it seems to me that something might have been
done.</p>
<p>I left Nottingham on Saturday after lunch&mdash;the weather was
hopeless&mdash;and I did not make use of the information I had for the
purposes of my paper. I was never a good journalist. But I went down to
Ailesworth on Monday morning, and found that Findlater and Stott had
already gone to Harley Street to see Graves, the King&rsquo;s
surgeon.</p>
<p>I followed them, and arrived at Graves&rsquo;s house <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43" name="pb43">43</a>]</span>while
Stott was in the consulting-room. I hocussed the butler and waited with
the patients. Among the papers, I came upon the famous caricature of
Stott in the current number of <i>Punch</i>&mdash;the
&ldquo;Stand-and-Deliver&rdquo; caricature, in which Stott is
represented with an arm about ten feet long, and the batsman is looking
wildly over his shoulder to square leg, bewildered, with no conception
from what direction the ball is coming. Underneath is written
&ldquo;Stott&rsquo;s New Theory&mdash;the Ricochet. Real Ginger.&rdquo;
While I was laughing over the cartoon, the butler came in and nodded to
me. I followed him out of the room and met Findlater and Stott in the
hall.</p>
<p>Findlater was in a state of profanity. I could not get a sensible
word out of him. He was in a white heat of pure rage. The butler, who
seemed as anxious as I to learn the verdict, was positively
frightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, for God&rsquo;s sake tell me what Graves said,&rdquo; I
protested.</p>
<p>Findlater&rsquo;s answer is unprintable, and told me nothing.</p>
<p>Stott, however, quite calm and self-possessed, volunteered the
information. &ldquo;Finger&rsquo;s got to come off, sir,&rdquo; he said
quietly. &ldquo;Doctor says if it ain&rsquo;t off to-day or to-morrer,
he won&rsquo;t answer for my &rsquo;and.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was the news I had to give to England. It <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44" name="pb44">44</a>]</span>was a
great coup from the journalistic point of view, but I made up my three
columns with a heavy heart, and the congratulations of my editor only
sickened me. I had some luck, but I should never have become a good
journalist.</p>
<p>The operation was performed successfully that evening, and
Stott&rsquo;s career was closed.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">I have already referred to the obsession which
dominated Stott after his accident, and I must now deal with that
overweening anxiety of his to teach his method to another man.</p>
<p>I did not see Stott again till August, and then I had a long talk
with him on the Ailesworth County Ground, as together we watched the
progress of Hampdenshire&rsquo;s defeat by Lancashire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I can&rsquo;t learn him <i>nothing</i>,&rdquo; he broke
out, as Flower was hit to the four corners of the ground,
&ldquo;&rsquo;alf vollies and long &rsquo;ops and then a full
pitch&mdash;&rsquo;e&rsquo;s a disgrace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve knocked him off his length,&rdquo; I protested.
&ldquo;On wicket like this&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stott shook his head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been trying to learn
&rsquo;im,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but he can&rsquo;t never learn.
&rsquo;E&rsquo;s got &rsquo;abits what you can&rsquo;t break &rsquo;im
of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it <i>is</i> difficult,&rdquo; I said vaguely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same with me,&rdquo; went on Stott, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="#pb45" name=
"pb45">45</a>]</span>trying to learn myself to bowl without my
finger&rdquo;&mdash;he held up his mutilated hand&mdash;&ldquo;or
left-&rsquo;anded; but I can&rsquo;t. If I&rsquo;d started that
way&#8202;&hellip;. No! I&rsquo;m always feeling for that finger as is
gone. A second-class bowler I might be in time, not better nor
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s early days yet,&rdquo; I ventured, intending
encouragement, but Stott frowned and shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to kid myself,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I
know. But I&rsquo;m going to find a youngster and learn &rsquo;im.
On&rsquo;y he must be young.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No &rsquo;abits, you know,&rdquo; he explained.</p>
<p>The next time I met Stott was in November. I ran up against him,
literally, one Friday afternoon in Ailesworth.</p>
<p>When he recognised me he asked me if I would care to walk out to
Stoke-Underhill with him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve took a cottage
there,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m to be married in a
fortnight&rsquo;s time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His circumstances certainly warranted such a venture. The proceeds
of matinee and benefit, invested for him by the Committee of the County
Club, produced an income of nearly two pounds a week, and in addition
to this he had his salary as groundsman. I tendered my
congratulations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! well, as to that, better wait a bit,&rdquo; said
Stott.</p>
<p>He walked with his hands in his pockets and his <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46" name="pb46">46</a>]</span>eyes on
the ground. He had the air of a man brooding over some project.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i> a lottery, of course &hellip;&rdquo; I began,
but he interrupted me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh that!&rdquo; he said, and kicked a stone into the ditch;
&ldquo;take my chances of that. It&rsquo;s the kid I&rsquo;m thinking
on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The kid?&rdquo; I repeated, doubtful whether he spoke of his
fianc&eacute;e, or whether his nuptials pointed an act of
reparation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What else &rsquo;ud I tie myself up for?&rdquo; asked Stott.
&ldquo;I must &rsquo;ave a kid of my own and learn &rsquo;im from his
cradle. It&rsquo;s come to that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I understand,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;teach him to
bowl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; replied Stott as an affirmative. &ldquo;Learn
&rsquo;im to bowl from his cradle; before &rsquo;e&rsquo;s got
&rsquo;abits. When I started I&rsquo;d never bowled a ball in my life,
and by good luck I started right. But I can&rsquo;t find another kid
over seven years old in England as ain&rsquo;t never bowled a ball
o&rsquo; some sort and started &rsquo;abits. I&rsquo;ve
tried&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you hope with your own boys&#8202;&hellip;?&rdquo; I
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not &rsquo;ope, it&rsquo;s a cert;&rdquo; said Stott.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see no boy of mine touches a ball afore he&rsquo;s
fourteen, and then &rsquo;e&rsquo;ll learn from me; and learn right.
From the first go off.&rdquo; He was silent for a few seconds, and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href="#pb47" name=
"pb47">47</a>]</span>then he broke out in a kind of ecstasy. &ldquo;My
Gawd, &rsquo;e&rsquo;ll be a bowler such as &rsquo;as never been, never
in this world. He&rsquo;ll start where I left orf.
He&rsquo;ll&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo; Words failed him, he fell back on
the expletive he had used, repeating it with an awed fervour. &ldquo;My
Gawd!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had never seen Stott in this mood before. It was a revelation to
me of the latent potentialities of the man, the remarkable depth and
quality of his ambitions&#8202;&hellip;.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">I intended to be present at Stott&rsquo;s wedding, but
I was not in England when it took place; indeed, for the next two years
and a half I was never in England for more than a few days at a time. I
sent him a wedding-present, an inkstand in the guise of a cricket ball,
with a pen-rack that was built of little silver wickets. They were
still advertised that Christmas as &ldquo;Stott inkstands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two years and a half of American life broke up many of my old habits
of thought. When I first returned to London I found that the cricket
news no longer held the same interest for me, and this may account for
the fact that I did not trouble for some time to look up my old friend
Stott.</p>
<p>In July, however, affairs took me to Ailesworth, and the
associations of the place naturally led me to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48" name="pb48">48</a>]</span>wonder
how Stott&rsquo;s marriage had turned out, and whether the much-desired
son had been born to him. When my business in Ailesworth was done, I
decided to walk out to Stoke-Underhill.</p>
<p>The road passes the County Ground, and a match was in progress, but
I walked by without stopping. I was wool-gathering. I was not thinking
of the man I was going to see, or I should have turned in at the County
Ground, where he would inevitably have been found. Instead, I was
thinking of the abnormal child I had seen in the train that day;
uselessly speculating and wondering.</p>
<p>When I reached Stoke-Underhill I found the cottage which Stott had
shown me. I had by then so far recovered my wits as to know that I
should not find Stott himself there, but from the look of the cottage I
judged that it was untenanted, so I made inquiries at the
post-office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; he don&rsquo;t live here, now, sir,&rdquo; said the
postmistress; &ldquo;he lives at Pym, now, sir, and rides into
Ailesworth on his bike.&rdquo; She was evidently about to furnish me
with other particulars, but I did not care to hear them. I was moody
and distrait. I was wondering why I should bother my head about so
insignificant a person as this Stott.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be sure to find Mr. Stott at the cricket
ground,&rdquo; the postmistress called after me.</p>
<p>Another two months of English life induced a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49" name="pb49">49</a>]</span>return
to my old habits of thought. I found myself reverting to old tastes and
interests. The reversion was a pleasant one. In the States I had been
forced out of my groove, compelled to work, to strive, to think
desperately if I would maintain any standing among my contemporaries.
But when the perpetual stimulus was removed, I soon fell back to the
less strenuous methods of my own country. I had time, once more, for
the calm reflection that is so unlike the urgent, forced, inventive
thought of the American journalist. I was braced by that thirty
months&rsquo; experience, perhaps hardened a little, but by September
my American life was fading into the background; I had begun to take an
interest in cricket again.</p>
<p>With the revival of my old interests, revived also my curiosity as
to Ginger Stott, and one Sunday in late September I decided to go down
to Pym.</p>
<p>It was a perfect day, and I thoroughly enjoyed my four-mile walk
from Great Hittenden Station.</p>
<p>Pym is a tiny hamlet made up of three farms and a dozen scattered
cottages. Perched on one of the highest summits of the Hampden Hills
and lost in the thick cover of beech woods, without a post-office or a
shop, Pym is the most perfectly isolated village within a reasonable
distance of London. As I sauntered up the mile-long lane that climbs
the steep hill, and is the only connection between Pym <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50" name="pb50">50</a>]</span>and
anything approaching a decent road, I thought that this was the place
to which I should like to retire for a year, in order to write the book
I had so often contemplated, and never found time to begin. This, I
reflected, was a place of peace, of freedom from all distraction, the
place for calm, contemplative meditation.</p>
<p>I met no one in the lane, and there was no sign of life when I
reached what I must call the village, though the word conveys a wrong
idea, for there is no street, merely a cottage here and there, dropped
haphazard, and situated without regard to its aspect. These cottages
lie all on one&rsquo;s left hand; to the right a stretch of grass soon
merges into bracken and bush, and then the beech woods enclose both,
and surge down into the valley and rise up again beyond, a great wave
of green; as I saw it then, not yet touched with the first flame of
autumn.</p>
<p>I inquired at the first cottage and received my direction to
Stott&rsquo;s dwelling. It lay up a little lane, the further of two
cottages joined together.</p>
<p>The door stood open, and after a moment&rsquo;s hesitation and a
light knock, I peered in.</p>
<p>Sitting in a rocking-chair was a woman with black, untidy eyebrows,
and on her knee, held with rigid attention, was the remarkable baby I
had seen in the train two months before. As I stood, doubtful and, I
will confess it, intimidated, suddenly cold and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51" name="pb51">51</a>]</span>nervous,
the child opened his eyes and honoured me with a cold stare. Then he
nodded, a reflective, recognisable nod.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;E remembers seein&rsquo; you in the train, sir,&rdquo;
said the woman, &ldquo;&rsquo;e never forgets any one. Did you want to
see my &rsquo;usband? &rsquo;E&rsquo;s upstairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So <i>this</i> was the boy who was designed by Stott to become the
greatest bowler the world had ever seen&#8202;&hellip;. <span class=

<p class="first">Stott maintained an obstinate silence as we walked
together up to the Common, a stretch of comparatively open ground on
the plateau of the hill. He walked with his hands in his pockets and
his head down, as he had walked out from Ailesworth with me nearly
three years before, but his mood was changed. I was conscious that he
was gloomy, depressed, perhaps a little unstrung. I was burning with
curiosity. Now that I was released from the thrall of the child&rsquo;s
presence, I was eager to hear all there was to tell of its history.</p>
<p>Presently we sat down under an ash-tree, one of three that guarded a
shallow, muddy pond skimmed with weed. Stott accepted my offer of a
cigarette, but seemed disinclined to break the silence.</p>
<p>I found nothing better to say than a repetition of the old phrase.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a very remarkable baby of yours, Stott,&rdquo; I
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he replied, his usual substitute for <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name=
"pb53">53</a>]</span>&ldquo;yes,&rdquo; and he picked up a piece of
dead wood and threw it into the little pond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How old is he?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nearly two year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can he &hellip;&rdquo; I paused; my imagination was
reconstructing the scene of the railway carriage, and I felt a reflex
of the hesitation shown by the rubicund man when he had asked the same
question. &ldquo;Can he &hellip; can he talk?&rdquo; It seemed so
absurd a question to ask, yet it was essentially a natural question in
the circumstances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He can, but he won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was startling enough, and I pressed my enquiry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know? Are you sure he can?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Only that aggravating, monosyllabic assent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Stott,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you want
to talk about the child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shrugged his shoulders and threw more wood into the pond with a
strained attentiveness as though he were peculiarly anxious to hit some
particular wafer of the vivid, floating weed. For a full five minutes
we maintained silence. I was trying to subdue my impatience and my
temper. I knew Stott well enough to know that if I displayed signs of
either, I should get no information from him. My self-control was
rewarded at last. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href="#pb54"
name="pb54">54</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve &rsquo;eard &rsquo;im speak,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;speak proper, too, not like a baby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused, and I grunted to show that I was listening, but as he
volunteered no further remark, I said: &ldquo;What did you hear him
say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dunno,&rdquo; replied Stott, &ldquo;somethin&rsquo; about
learnin&rsquo; and talkin&rsquo;. I didn&rsquo;t get the rights of it,
but the missus near fainted&mdash;<i>she</i> thinks &rsquo;e&rsquo;s
Gawd A&rsquo;mighty or suthing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why don&rsquo;t you make him speak?&rdquo; I asked
deliberately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make &rsquo;im!&rdquo; said Stott, with a curl of his lip,
&ldquo;<i>make</i> &rsquo;im! You try it on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I knew I was acting a part, but I wanted to provoke more
information. &ldquo;Well! Why not?&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Cos &rsquo;e&rsquo;d look at you&mdash;that&rsquo;s
why not,&rdquo; replied Stott, &ldquo;and you can&rsquo;t no more face
&rsquo;im than a dog can face a man. I shan&rsquo;t stand it much
longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Curious,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;very curious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! he&rsquo;s a blarsted freak, that&rsquo;s what &rsquo;e
is,&rdquo; said Stott, getting to his feet and beginning to pace
moodily up and down.</p>
<p>I did not interrupt him. I was thinking of this man who had drawn
huge crowds from every part of England, who had been a national hero,
and who, now, was unable to face his own child. Presently Stott broke
out again. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55" name=
"pb55">55</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;To think of all the trouble I took when &rsquo;e was
comin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he said, stopping in front of me. &ldquo;There was
nothin&rsquo; the missus fancied as I wouldn&rsquo;t get. We was
livin&rsquo; in Stoke then.&rdquo; He made a movement of his head in
the direction of Ailesworth. &ldquo;Not as she was difficult,&rdquo; he
went on thoughtfully. &ldquo;She used to say &lsquo;I mussent get
&rsquo;abits, George,&rsquo; Caught that from me; I was always on about
that&mdash;then. You know, thinkin&rsquo; of learnin&rsquo; &rsquo;im
bowlin&rsquo;. Things was different then; afore <i>&rsquo;e</i>
came.&rdquo; He paused again, evidently thinking of his troubles.</p>
<p>Sympathetically, I was wondering how far the child had separated
husband and wife. There was the making of a tragedy here, I thought;
but when Stott, after another period of pacing up and down, began to
speak again I found that his tragedy was of another kind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Learn <i>&rsquo;im</i> bowling!&rdquo; he said, and laughed a
mirthless laugh. &ldquo;My Gawd! it &rsquo;ud take something. No fear;
that little game&rsquo;s off. And I could a&rsquo; done it if
he&rsquo;d been a decent or&rsquo;nery child, &rsquo;stead of a
blarsted freak. There won&rsquo;t never be another, neither. This one
pretty near killed the missus. Doctor said it&rsquo;d be &rsquo;er
last&#8202;&hellip;. With an &rsquo;ead like that, whacher
expect?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can he walk?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! Gets about easy enough for all &rsquo;is body and legs is
so small. When the missus tries to stop <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

"pb56">56</a>]</span>&rsquo;im&mdash;she&rsquo;s afraid
&rsquo;e&rsquo;ll go over&mdash;&rsquo;e just looks at &rsquo;er and
she &rsquo;as to let &rsquo;im &rsquo;ave &rsquo;is own way.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="first">Later, I reverted to that speech of the child&rsquo;s,
that intelligent, illuminating speech that seemed to prove that there
was indeed a powerful, thoughtful mind behind those profoundly
speculative eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That time he spoke, Stott,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;was he
alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; assented Stott. &ldquo;In the garden,
practisin&rsquo; walkin&rsquo; all by &rsquo;imself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was that the only time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only time <i>I&rsquo;ve</i> &rsquo;eard &rsquo;im.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it lately?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Bout six weeks ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he has never made a sound otherwise, cried,
laughed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ardly. &rsquo;E gives a sort o&rsquo; grunt sometimes,
when e&rsquo; wants anything&mdash;and points.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s very intelligent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Worse than that, &rsquo;e&rsquo;s a freak, I tell
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the repetition of this damning description, Stott fell back
into his moody pacing, and this time I failed to rouse him from his
gloom. &ldquo;Oh! forget it,&rdquo; he broke out once, when I asked him
another question, and I saw that he was not likely to give me any more
information that day. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="#pb57"
name="pb57">57</a>]</span></p>
<p>We walked back together, and I said good-bye to him at the end of
the lane which led up to his cottage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not comin&rsquo; up?&rdquo; he asked, with a nod of his head
towards his home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well! I have to catch that train &hellip;&rdquo; I
prevaricated, looking at my watch. I did not wish to see that child
again; my distaste was even stronger than my curiosity.</p>
<p>Stott grinned. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t &rsquo;ave many
visitors,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll come a bit farther
with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He came to the bottom of the hill, and after he left me he took the
road that goes over the hill to Wenderby. It would be about seven miles
back to Pym by that road&#8202;&hellip;.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">I spent the next afternoon in the Reading Room of the
British Museum. I was searching for a precedent, and at last I found
one in the story of Christian Heinrich Heinecken,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1259src" href="#xd26e1259" name="xd26e1259src">1</a> who was born
at <span class="corr" id="xd26e1273" title=
"Source: Lubeck">L&uuml;beck</span> on February 6, 1721. There were
marked points of difference between the development of Heinecken and
that of Stott&rsquo;s child. Heinecken was physically feeble; at the
age of three he was still being fed at the breast. The Stott precocity
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href="#pb58" name=
"pb58">58</a>]</span>appeared to be physically strong; his body looked
small and undeveloped, it is true, but this was partly an illusion
produced by the abnormal size of the head. Again Heinecken learned to
speak very early; at ten months old he was asking intelligent
questions, at eighteen months he was studying history, geography, Latin
and anatomy; whereas the Stott child had only once been heard to speak
at the age of two years, and had not, apparently, begun any study at
all.</p>
<p>From this comparison it might seem at first that the balance of
precocity lay in the Heinecken scale. I drew another inference. I
argued that the genius of the Stott child far outweighed the genius of
Christian Heinecken.</p>
<p>Little Heinecken in his four years of life suffered the mental
experience&mdash;with certain necessary limitations&mdash;of a
developed brain. He gathered knowledge as an ordinary child gathers
knowledge, the only difference being that his rate of assimilation was
as ten to one.</p>
<p>But little Stott had gathered no knowledge from books. He had been
born of ignorant parents, he was being brought up among uneducated
people. Yet he had wonderful intellectual gifts: surely he must have
one above all others&mdash;the gift of reason. His brain must be
constructive, logical; he must have the power of deduction. He must
even at an <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59" name=
"pb59">59</a>]</span>extraordinarily early age, say six months, have
developed some theory of life. He must be withholding his energy,
deliberately; declining to exhibit his powers, holding his marvellous
faculties in reserve. Here was surely a case of genius which,
comparable in some respects to the genius of Heinecken, yet far
exceeded it.</p>
<p>As I developed my theory, my eagerness grew. And then suddenly an
inspiration came to me. In my excitement I spoke aloud and smacked the
desk in front of me with my open hand. &ldquo;Why, of course!&rdquo; I
said. &ldquo;That is the key.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An old man in the next seat scowled fiercely. The attendants in the
central circular desk all looked up. Other readers turned round and
stared at me. I had violated the sacred laws of the Reading Room. I saw
one of the librarians make a sign to an attendant and point to me.</p>
<p>I gathered up my books quickly and returned them at the central
desk. My self-consciousness had returned, and I was anxious to be away
from the observation of the many dilettante readers who found my
appearance more engrossing than the books with which they were dallying
on some pretext or another.</p>
<p>Yet, curiously, when I reached the street, the theory which had come
to me in the Museum with the force and vividness of an illuminating
dream <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60" name=
"pb60">60</a>]</span>had lost some of its glamour. Nevertheless, I set
it out as it then shaped itself in my mind.</p>
<p>The great restraining force in the evolution of man, so I thought,
has been the restriction imposed by habit. What we call instinct is a
hereditary habit. This is the first guiding principle in the life of
the human infant. Upon this instinct we immediately superimpose the
habits of reason, all the bodily and intellectual conventions that have
been handed down from generation to generation. We learn everything we
know as children by the hereditary, simian habit of imitation. The
child of intellectual, cultured parents, born into savage surroundings,
becomes the slave of this inherited habit&mdash;call it tendency, if
you will, the intention is the same. I elaborated the theory by
instance and introspection, and found no flaw in it&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>And here, by some freak of nature, was a child born without these
habits. During the period of gestation, one thought had dominated the
minds of both parents&mdash;the desire to have a son born without
habits. It does not seriously affect the theory that the desire had a
peculiar end in view; the wish, the urgent, controlling, omnipotent
will had been there, and the result included far more than the specific
intention.</p>
<p>Already some of my distaste for the Stott child had vanished. It was
accountable, and therefore <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href=
"#pb61" name="pb61">61</a>]</span>no longer fearful. The child was
supernormal, a cause of fear to the normal man, as all truly
supernormal things are to our primitive, animal instincts. This is the
fear of the wild thing; when we can explain and give reasons, the
horror vanishes. We are men again.</p>
<p>I did not quite recover the glow of my first inspiration, but the
theory remained with me; I decided to make a study of the child, to
submit knowledge to his reason. I would stand between him and the
delimiting training of the pedagogue, I thought.</p>
<p>Then I reached home, and my life was changed.</p>
<p>This story is not of my own life, and I have no wish to enter into
the curious and saddening experiences which stood between me and the
child of Ginger Stott for nearly six years. In that time my thoughts
strayed now and again to that cottage in the little hamlet on those
wooded hills. Often I thought &ldquo;When I have time I will go and see
that child again if he is alive.&rdquo; But as the years passed, the
memory of him grew dim, even the memory of his father was blurred over
by a thousand new impressions. So it chanced that for nearly six years
I heard no word of Stott and his supernormal infant, and then chance
again intervened. My long period of sorrow came to an end almost as
suddenly as it had begun, and by a coincidence I was once <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62" name="pb62">62</a>]</span>more
entangled in the strange web of the phenomenal.</p>
<p>In this story of Victor Stott I have bridged these six years in the
pages that follow. In doing this I have been compelled to draw to a
certain extent on my imagination, but the main facts are true. They
have been gathered from first-hand authority only, from Henty Challis,
from Mrs. Stott, and from her husband; though none, I must confess, has
been checked by that soundest of all authorities, Victor Stott himself,
who might have given me every particular in accurate detail, had it not
been for those peculiarities of his which will be explained fully in
the proper place. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63"

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Stoke-Underhill lies in the flat of the valley that
separates the Hampden from the Quainton Hills. The main road from
London to Ailesworth does not pass through Stoke, but from the highway
you can see the ascent of the bridge over the railway, down the vista
of the straight mile of side road; and, beyond, a glimpse of scattered
cottages. That is all, and as a matter of fact, no one who is not
keeping a sharp look-out would ever notice the village, for the eye is
drawn to admire the bluff of Deane Hill, the highest point of the
Hampdens, which lowers over the little hamlet of Stoke and gives it a
second name; and to the church tower of Chilborough Beacon, away to the
right, another landmark.</p>
<p>The attraction which Stoke-Underhill held for Stott, lay not in its
seclusion or its picturesqueness <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb66"
href="#pb66" name="pb66">66</a>]</span>but in its nearness to the
County Ground. Stott could ride the two flat miles which separated him
from the scene of his work in ten minutes, and Ailesworth station is
only a mile beyond. So when he found that there was a suitable cottage
to let in Stoke, he looked no farther for a home; he was completely
satisfied.</p>
<p>Stott&rsquo;s absorption in any matter that was occupying his mind,
made him exceedingly careless about the detail of his affairs. He took
the first cottage that offered when he looked for a home, he took the
first woman who offered when he looked for a wife.</p>
<p>Stott was not an attractive man to women. He was short and plain,
and he had an appearance of being slightly deformed, a
&ldquo;monkeyish&rdquo; look, due to his build and his long arms.
Still, he was famous, and might, doubtless, have been accepted by a
dozen comely young women for that reason, even after his accident. But
if Stott was unattractive to women, women were even more unattractive
to Stott. &ldquo;No opinion of women?&rdquo; he used to say.
&ldquo;Ever seen a gel try to throw a cricket ball? You &rsquo;ave?
Well, ain&rsquo;t that enough to put you off women?&rdquo; That was
Stott&rsquo;s intellectual standard; physically, he had never felt
drawn to women.</p>
<p>Ellen Mary Jakes exhibited no superiority over her sisters in the
matter of throwing a cricket ball. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb67"
href="#pb67" name="pb67">67</a>]</span>She was a friend of
Ginger&rsquo;s mother, and she was a woman of forty-two, who had long
since been relegated to some remote shelf of the matrimonial exchange.
But her physical disadvantages were outbalanced by her mental
qualities. Ellen Mary was not a book-worm, she read nothing but the
evening and Sunday papers, but she had a reasoning and intelligent
mind.</p>
<p>She had often contemplated the state of matrimony, and had made more
than one tentative essay in that direction. She had walked out with
three or four sprigs of the Ailesworth bourgeoisie in her time, and the
shadow of middle-age had crept upon her before she realised that
however pliant her disposition, her lack of physical charm put her at
the mercy of the first bright-eyed rival. At thirty-five Ellen had
decided, with admirable philosophy, that marriage was not for her, and
had assumed, with apparent complacency, the outward evidences of a
dignified spinsterhood. She had discarded gay hats and ribbons,
imitation jewellery, unreliable cheap shoes, and chill diaphanous
stockings, and had found some solace for her singleness in more
comfortable and suitable apparel.</p>
<p>When Ellen, a declared spinster of seven years&rsquo; standing, was
first taken into the confidence of Ginger Stott&rsquo;s mother, the
scheme which she afterwards elaborated immediately presented itself to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68" name=
"pb68">68</a>]</span>her mind. This fact is a curious instance of Ellen
Mary&rsquo;s mobility of intellect, and the student of heredity may
here find matter for careful thought.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1351src" href="#xd26e1351" name="xd26e1351src">1</a></p>
<p>The confidence in question was Ginger&rsquo;s declared intention of
becoming the father of the world&rsquo;s greatest bowler. Mrs. Stott
was a dark, garrulous, rather deaf little woman, with a keen eye for
the main chance; she might have become a successful woman of business
if she had not been by nature both stingy and a cheat. When her son
presented his determination, her first thought was to find some woman
who would not dissipate her son&rsquo;s substance, and in her
opinion&mdash;not expressed to Ginger&mdash;the advertised purpose of
the contemplated marriage evidenced a wasteful disposition.</p>
<p>Mrs. Stott did not think of Ellen Mary as a possible
daughter-in-law, but she did hold forth for an hour and three-quarters
on the contemptible qualities of the young maidens, first of
Ailesworth, and then with a wider swoop that was not justified by her
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href="#pb69" name=
"pb69">69</a>]</span>limited experience, of the girls of England,
Scotland, and Ireland at large.</p>
<p>It required the flexible reasoning powers of Ellen Mary to find a
solution of the problem. Any ordinary, average woman of forty-two, a
declared spinster of seven years&rsquo; standing, who had lived all her
life in a provincial town, would have been mentally unable to realise
the possibilities of the situation. Such a representative of the
decaying sexual instinct would have needed the stimulus of courtship,
at the least of some hint of preference displayed by the suitor. Ruled
by the conventions which hold her sex in bondage, she would have deemed
it unwomanly to make advances by any means other than innuendo, the
subtle suggestions which are the instruments of her sex, but which are
often too delicate to pierce the understanding of the obtuse and
slow-witted male.</p>
<p>Ellen Mary stood outside the ruck that determines the destinies of
all such typical representatives. She considered the idea presented to
her by Mrs. Stott with an open and mobile intelligence. She weighed the
character of Ginger, the possibilities of rejection, and the influence
of Mrs. Stott; and she gave no thought to the conventions, nor to the
criticisms of Ailesworth society. When she had decided that such
chances as she could calculate were in her favour, Ellen made up her
mind, walked out <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href="#pb70" name=
"pb70">70</a>]</span>to the County Ground one windy October forenoon,
and discovered Ginger experimenting with grass seed in a shed off the
pavilion.</p>
<p>In this shed she offered herself, while Ginger worked on, attentive
but unresponsive. Perhaps she did not make an offer so much as state a
case. A masterly case, without question; for who can doubt that Stott,
however procrastinating and unwilling to make a definite overture, must
already have had some type of womanhood in his mind; some conception,
the seed of an ideal.</p>
<p>I find a quality of romance in this courageous and unusual wooing of
Ellen Mary&rsquo;s; but more, I find evidences of the remarkable
quality of her intelligence. In other circumstances the name of Ellen
Mary Jakes might have stood for individual achievement, instead, she is
remembered as a common woman who <i>happened</i> to be the mother of
Victor Stott. But when the facts are examined, can we say that chance
entered? If ever the birth of a child was deliberately designed by both
parents, it was in the case under consideration. And what a strange
setting to the inception.</p>
<p>Ellen Mary, a gaunt, tall, somewhat untidy woman, stood at the
narrow door of the little shed off the Ailesworth pavilion; with one
hand, shoulder-high, she steadied herself against the door frame, with
the other she continually pushed forward <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb71" href="#pb71" name="pb71">71</a>]</span>the rusty bonnet which
had been loosened during her walk by the equinoctial gale that now tore
at the door of the shed, and necessitated the employment of a wary foot
to keep the door from slamming. With all these distractions she still
made good her case, though she had to raise her voice above the
multitudinous sounds of the wind, and though she had to address the
unresponsive shoulders of a man who bent over shallow trays of earth
set on a trestle table under the small and dirty window. It is heroic,
but she had her reward in full measure. Presently her voice ceased, and
she waited in silence for the answer that should decide her destiny.
There was an interval broken only by the tireless passion of the wind,
and then Ginger Stott, the best-known man in England, looked up and
stared through the incrusted pane of glass before him at the dim vision
of grass and swaying hedge. Unconsciously his hands strayed to his
pockets, and then he said in a low, thoughtful voice: &ldquo;Well! I
dunno why not.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Dr. O&rsquo;Connell&rsquo;s face was white and drawn,
and the redness of his eyelids more pronounced than ever as he faced
Stott in the pale October dawn. He clutched at his beard with a
nervous, combing movement, as he shook his head decidedly in answer to
the question put to him<span class="corr" id="xd26e1383" title=
"Source: ,">.</span> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href="#pb72"
name="pb72">72</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s not dead, now, &rsquo;twill be in very few
hours,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Stott was shaken by the feeble passion of a man who has spent many
weary hours of suspense. His anger thrilled out in a feeble stream of
hackneyed profanities.</p>
<p>O&rsquo;Connell looked down on him with contempt. At sunrise, after
a sleepless night, a man is a creature of unrealised emotions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn it, control yourself, man!&rdquo; growled
O&rsquo;Connell, himself uncontrolled, &ldquo;your wife&rsquo;ll pull
through with care, though she&rsquo;ll never have another child.&rdquo;
O&rsquo;Connell did not understand; he was an Irishman, and no
cricketer; he had been called in because he had a reputation for his
skill in obstetrics.</p>
<p>Stott stared at him fiercely. The two men seemed as if about to
grapple desperately for life in the windy, grey twilight.</p>
<p>O&rsquo;Connell recovered his self-control first, and began again to
claw nervously at his beard. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a fool,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s only what you could expect. Her first child,
and her a woman of near fifty.&rdquo; He returned to the upstairs room;
Stott seized his cap and went out into the chill world of sunrise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll do, if there are no complications,&rdquo; said
O&rsquo;Connell to the nurse, as he bent over the still, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73" name=
"pb73">73</a>]</span>exhausted figure of Mrs. Stott. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
a wonderful woman to have delivered such a child alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The nurse shivered, and avoiding any glance at the huddle that lay
on an improvised sofa-bed, she said: &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t live, can
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>O&rsquo;Connell, still intent on his first patient, shook his head.
&ldquo;Never cried after delivery,&rdquo; he muttered &ldquo;&mdash;the
worst sign.&rdquo; He was silent for a moment and then he added:
&ldquo;But, to be sure, it&rsquo;s a freak of some kind.&rdquo; His
scientific curiosity led him to make a further investigation. He left
the bed and began to examine the huddle on the sofa-couch. Victor Stott
owed his life, in the first instance, to this scientific curiosity of
O&rsquo;Connell&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>The nurse, a capable, but sentimental woman, turned to the window
and looked out at the watery trickle of feeble sunlight that now
illumined the wilderness of Stott&rsquo;s garden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nurse!&rdquo; The imperative call startled her; she turned
nervously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, doctor?&rdquo; she said, making no movement towards
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come here!&rdquo; O&rsquo;Connell was kneeling by the sofa.
&ldquo;There seems to be complete paralysis of all the motor
centres,&rdquo; he went on; &ldquo;but the child&rsquo;s not dead.
We&rsquo;ll try artificial respiration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The nurse overcame her repugnance by a visible effort. &ldquo;Is it
&hellip; is it worth while?&rdquo; she asked, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74" name=
"pb74">74</a>]</span>regarding the flaccid, tumbled, wax-like thing,
with its bloated, white globe of a skull. Every muscle of it was
relaxed and limp, its eyes shut, its tiny jaw hanging.
&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be better to let it
die&#8202;&hellip;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>O&rsquo;Connell did not seem to hear her. He waved an impatient hand
for her assistance. &ldquo;Outside my experience,&rdquo; he muttered,
&ldquo;no heart-beat discernible, no breath &hellip; yet it is
indubitably alive.&rdquo; He depressed the soft, plastic ribs and gave
the feeble heart a gentle squeeze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s beating,&rdquo; he ejaculated, after a pause, with
an ear close to the little chest, &ldquo;but still no breath!
Come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The diminutive lungs were as readily open to suggestion as the wee
heart: a few movements of the twigs they called arms, and the breath
came. O&rsquo;Connell closed the mouth and it remained closed, adjusted
the limbs, and they stayed in the positions in which they were placed.
At last he gently lifted the lids of the eyes.</p>
<p>The nurse shivered and drew back. Even O&rsquo;Connell was startled,
for the eyes that stared into his own seemed to be heavy with a
brooding intelligence&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Stott came back at ten o&rsquo;clock, after a morose trudge through
the misty rain. He found the nurse in the sitting-room. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75" name="pb75">75</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Doctor gone?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>The nurse nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead, I suppose?&rdquo; Stott gave an upward twist of his
head towards the room above.</p>
<p>The nurse shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t live though?&rdquo; There was a note of faint
hope in his voice.</p>
<p>The nurse drew herself together and sighed deeply. &ldquo;Yes! we
believe it&rsquo;ll live, Mr. Stott,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But
&hellip; it&rsquo;s a very remarkable baby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How that phrase always recurred!</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There were no complications, but Mrs. Stott&rsquo;s
recovery was not a rapid one. It was considered advisable that she
should not see the child. She thought that they were lying to her, that
the child was dead and, so, resigned herself. But her husband saw
it.</p>
<p>He had never seen so young an infant before, and, just for one
moment, he believed that it was a normal child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What an &rsquo;ead!&rdquo; was his first ejaculation, and
then he realised the significance of that sign. Fear came into his
eyes, and his mouth fell open. &ldquo;&rsquo;Ere, I say, nurse,
it&rsquo;s &hellip; it&rsquo;s a wrong &rsquo;un, ain&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo; he gasped. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76"
name="pb76">76</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m <i>sure</i> I can&rsquo;t tell you, Mr.
Stott,&rdquo; broke out the nurse hysterically. She had been feeding
and tending that curious baby for three hours, and she was on the verge
of a break-down. There was no wet-nurse to be had, but a woman from the
village had been sent for. She was expected every moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More like a tadpole than anything,&rdquo; mused the unhappy
father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Mr. Stott, for goodness&rsquo; sake,
<i>don&rsquo;t</i>,&rdquo; cried the nurse. &ldquo;If you only
knew&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Knew what?&rdquo; questioned Stott, still staring at the
motionless figure of his son, who lay with closed eyes, apparently
unconscious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo;
began the nurse, and then after a pause, during which she seemed to
struggle for some means of expression, she continued with a sigh of
utter weariness, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll know when it opens its eyes. Oh!
Why doesn&rsquo;t that woman come, the woman you sent for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be &rsquo;ere directly,&rdquo; replied Stott.
&ldquo;What d&rsquo;you mean about there bein&rsquo; something &hellip;
something what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncanny,&rdquo; said the nurse without conviction. &ldquo;I
do wish that woman would come. I&rsquo;ve been up the best part of the
night, and now&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncanny? As how?&rdquo; persisted Stott.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not normal,&rdquo; explained the nurse. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
tell you more than that.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb77"
href="#pb77" name="pb77">77</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;But &rsquo;ow? What way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not receive an answer then; for the long expected relief came
at last, a great hulk of a woman, who became voluble when she saw the
child she had come to nurse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! dear, oh! dear,&rdquo; the stream began. &ldquo;How
unforchnit, and &rsquo;er first, too. It&rsquo;ll be a idjit, I&rsquo;m
afraid. Mrs. &rsquo;Arrison&rsquo;s third was the very spit of
it&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stream ran on, but Stott heard no more. An idiot! He had
fathered an idiot! That was the end of his dreams and ambitions! He had
had an hour&rsquo;s sleep on the sitting-room sofa. He went out to his
work at the County Ground with a heart full of blasphemy.</p>
<p>When he returned at four o&rsquo;clock he met the stout woman on the
doorstep. She put up a hand to her rolling breast, closed her eyes
tightly, and gasped as though completely overcome by this trifling
rencounter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ow is it?&rdquo; questioned the obsessed Stott.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear! Oh dear!&rdquo; panted the stout woman, &ldquo;the
leas&rsquo; thing upsets me this afternoon&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo; She
wandered away into irrelevant fluency, but Stott was autocratic; his
insistent questions overcame the inertia of even Mrs. Reade at last.
The substance of her information, freed from extraneous matter, was as
follows: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href="#pb78" name=
"pb78">78</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! &rsquo;ealthy? It&rsquo;ll live, I&rsquo;ve no doubt, if
that&rsquo;s what you mean; but &rsquo;elpless&#8202;&hellip;! There,
&rsquo;elpless is no word&#8202;&hellip;. Learn &rsquo;im to take the
bottle, learn &rsquo;im to close &rsquo;is &rsquo;ands, learn &rsquo;im
to go to sleep, learn &rsquo;im everythink. I&rsquo;ve never seen
nothink like it, never in all my days, and I&rsquo;ve &rsquo;elped to
bring a few into the world&#8202;&hellip;. I can&rsquo;t begin to tell
you about it, Mr. Stott, and that&rsquo;s the solemn truth. When
&rsquo;e first looked at me, I near &rsquo;ad a faint. A old-fashioned,
wise sort of look as &rsquo;e might &rsquo;a been a &rsquo;undred.
&lsquo;Lord &rsquo;elp us, nurse,&rsquo; I says, &lsquo;Lord help
us.&rsquo; I was that opset, I didn&rsquo;t rightly know what I was
a-saying&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stott pushed past the agitated Mrs. Reade, and went into the
sitting-room. He had had neither breakfast nor lunch; there was no sign
of any preparation for his tea, and the fireplace was grey with the
cinders of last night&rsquo;s fire. For some minutes he sat in deep
despondency, a hero faced with the uncompromising detail of domestic
neglect. Then he rose and called to the nurse.</p>
<p>She appeared at the head of the steep, narrow staircase.
&ldquo;Sh!&rdquo; she warned, with a finger to her lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; out again,&rdquo; said Stott in a
slightly modulated voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Reade&rsquo;s coming back presently,&rdquo; replied the
nurse, and looked over her shoulder. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb79" href="#pb79" name="pb79">79</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Want me to wait?&rdquo; asked Stott.</p>
<p>The nurse came down a few steps. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only in case any
one was wanted,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got two of
&rsquo;em on my hands, you see. They&rsquo;re both doing well as far as
that goes. Only&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo; She broke off and drifted into
small talk. Ever and again she stopped and listened intently, and
looked back towards the half-open door of the upstairs room.</p>
<p>Stott fidgeted, and then, as the flow of conversation gave no sign
of running dry, he damned it abruptly. &ldquo;Look &rsquo;ere,
miss,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve &rsquo;ad nothing to eat since
last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! dear!&rdquo; ejaculated the nurse.
&ldquo;If&mdash;perhaps, if you&rsquo;d just stay here and listen, I
could get you something.&rdquo; She seemed relieved to have some excuse
for coming down.</p>
<p>While she bustled about the kitchen, Stott, half-way upstairs,
stayed and listened. The house was very silent, the only sound was the
hushed clatter made by the nurse in the kitchen. There was an
atmosphere of wariness about the place that affected even so callous a
person as Stott. He listened with strained attention, his eyes fixed on
the half-open door. He was not an imaginative man, but he was beset
with apprehension as to what lay behind that door. He looked for
something inhuman that might come crawling through the aperture,
something <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80" name=
"pb80">80</a>]</span>grotesque, preternaturally wise and
threatening&mdash;something horribly unnatural.</p>
<p>The window of the upstairs room was evidently open, and now and
again the door creaked faintly. When that happened Stott gripped the
handrail, and grew damp and hot. He looked always at the shadows under
the door&mdash;if it crawled&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>The nurse stood at the door of the sitting-room while Stott ate, and
presently Mrs. Reade came grunting and panting up the brick path.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going out, now,&rdquo; said Stott resolutely, and
he rose to his feet, though his meal was barely finished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be back before Mrs. Reade goes?&rdquo; asked the
nurse, and passed a hand over her tired eyes. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be
here till ten o&rsquo;clock. I&rsquo;m going to lie down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back by ten,&rdquo; Stott assured her as he
went out.</p>
<p>He did come back at ten o&rsquo;clock, but he was stupidly
drunk.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Stotts&rsquo; cottage was no place to live in
during the next few days, but the nurse made one stipulation; Mr. Stott
must come home to sleep. He slept on an improvised bed in the
sitting-room, and during the night the nurse came down many times and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81" name=
"pb81">81</a>]</span>listened to the sound of his snores. She would put
her ear against the door, and rest her nerves with the thought of human
companionship. Sometimes she opened the door quietly and watched him as
he slept. Except at night, when he was rarely quite sober, Stott only
visited his cottage once a day, at lunch time; from seven in the
morning till ten at night he remained in Ailesworth save for this one
call of inquiry.</p>
<p>It was such a still house. Ellen Mary only spoke when speech was
absolutely required, and then her words were the fewest possible, and
were spoken in a whisper. The child made no sound of any kind. Even
Mrs. Reade tried to subdue her stertorous breathing, to move with less
ponderous quakings. The neighbours told her she looked thinner.</p>
<p>Little wonder that during the long night vigil the nurse, moving
silently between the two upstairs rooms, should pause on the landing
and lean over the handrail; little wonder that she should give a long
sigh of relief when she heard the music of Stott&rsquo;s snore ascend
from the sitting-room.</p>
<p>O&rsquo;Connell called twice every day during the first week, not
because it was necessary for him to visit his two patients, but because
the infant fascinated him. He would wait for it to open its eyes, and
then would get up and leave the room hurriedly. Always he intended to
return the infant&rsquo;s stare, but when <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb82" href="#pb82" name="pb82">82</a>]</span>the opportunity was given
to him, he always rose and left the room&mdash;no matter how long and
deliberately he had braced himself to another course of action.</p>
<p>It was on a Thursday that the baby was born, and it was on the
following Thursday that the circumstance of the household was
reshaped.</p>
<p>O&rsquo;Connell came in the morning, full of resolution. After he
had pronounced Mrs. Stott well on the way to recovery, he paid the
usual visit to his younger patient. The child lay, relaxed, at full
length, in the little cot which had been provided for him. His eyes
were, as usual, closed, and he had all the appearance of the ordinary
hydrocephalic idiot.</p>
<p>O&rsquo;Connell sat down by the cot, listened to the child&rsquo;s
breathing and heart-beat, lifted and let fall again the lax wrist,
turned back the eyelid, revealing only the white of the upturned
eyeball, and then composed himself to await the natural waking of the
child, if it were asleep&mdash;always a matter of uncertainty.</p>
<p>The nurse stood near him, silent, but she looked away from the
cot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hydrocephalus!&rdquo; murmured O&rsquo;Connell, staring at
his tiny patient, &ldquo;hydrocephalus, without a doubt. Eh?
nurse!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, perhaps! I don&rsquo;t know, doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, not a doubt of it, not a doubt,&rdquo; repeated
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83" name=
"pb83">83</a>]</span>O&rsquo;Connell, and then came a flicker of the
child&rsquo;s eyelids and a weak crumpling of the tiny hand.</p>
<p>O&rsquo;Connell caught his breath and clawed at his beard;
&ldquo;Hydrocephalus,&rdquo; he muttered with set jaw and drawn
eyebrows.</p>
<p>The tiny hand straightened with a movement that suggested the
recovery of crushed grass, the mouth opened with a microscopic yawn,
and then the eyelids were slowly raised and a steady unwavering stare
of profoundest intelligence met O&rsquo;Connell&rsquo;s gaze.</p>
<p>He clenched his hands, shifted in his chair, and then rose abruptly
and turned to the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;it won&rsquo;t be necessary for me to come again,
nurse,&rdquo; he said curtly; &ldquo;they are both doing perfectly
well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not come again?&rdquo; There was dismay in the nurse&rsquo;s
question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No! It&rsquo;s unnecessary&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo; He
broke off, and made for the door without another glance in the
direction of the cot.</p>
<p>Nurse followed him downstairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I&rsquo;m wanted&mdash;you can easily send for me,&rdquo;
said O&rsquo;Connell, as he went out. As he moved away he dragged at
his beard and murmured &ldquo;Hydrocephalus, not a doubt of
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Following his departure, Mrs. Reade heard curious and most unwonted
laughter, and cautiously blundered <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84"
href="#pb84" name="pb84">84</a>]</span>downstairs to investigate. She
found the nurse in an advanced condition of hysteria, laughing,
gurgling, weeping, and intermittently crying in a shrill voice:
&ldquo;Oh! Lord have mercy; Lord ha&rsquo; mercy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, see you &rsquo;ere, my dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Reade,
when nurse had been recovered to a red-eyed sanity, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
time she was told. I&rsquo;ve never &rsquo;eld with keepin&rsquo; it
from &rsquo;er, myself, and I&rsquo;ve &rsquo;ad more experience than
many&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo; Mrs. Reade argued with abundant recourse to
parenthesis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is she strog edough?&rdquo; asked the nurse, still with tears
in her voice; &ldquo;cad she bear the sight of hib?&rdquo; She blew her
nose vigorously, and then continued with greater clearness:
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it may turn her head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Out of her deep store of wisdom, Mrs. Reade produced a fact which
she elaborated and confirmed by apt illustration, adducing more
particularly the instance of Mrs. Harrison&rsquo;s third.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s &rsquo;is mother,&rdquo; was the essence of her
argument, a fact of deep and strange significance.</p>
<p>The nurse yielded, and so the circumstance of Stott&rsquo;s
household was changed, and Stott himself was once more able to come
home to meals.</p>
<p>The nurse, wisely, left all diplomacy to the capable Mrs. Reade, a
woman specially fitted by nature for the breaking of news. She
delivered a long, a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85"
name="pb85">85</a>]</span>record-breaking circumlocution, and it seemed
that Ellen Mary, who lay with closed eyes, gathered no hint of its
import. But when the impressive harangue was slowly rustling to
collapse like an exhausted balloon, she opened her eyes and said quite
clearly,</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with &rsquo;im, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The question had the effect of reinflation, but at last the child
itself was brought, and it was open-eyed.</p>
<p>The supreme ambition of all great women&mdash;and have not all women
the potentialities of greatness?&mdash;is to give birth to a god. That
ambition it is which is marred by the disappointing birth of a female
child&mdash;when the man-child is born, there is always hope, and slow
is the realisation of failure. That realisation never came to Ellen
Mary. She accepted her child with the fear that is adoration. When she
dropped her eyes before her god&rsquo;s searching glance, she did it in
reverence. She hid her faith from the world, but in her heart she
believed that she was blessed above all women. In secret, she
worshipped the inscrutable wonder that had used her as the instrument
of his incarnation. Perhaps she was right&#8202;&hellip;. <span class=

of genius shows that in a percentage of cases so large as to exclude
the possibility of coincidence, the exceptional man, whether in the

magnificent powers through the female line. Mr. Galton, it is true, did
not make a great point of this curious observation, but the tendency of

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The village of Stoke was no whit intimidated by the
news that Mrs. Reade sowed abroad. The women exclaimed and chattered,
the men gaped and shook their heads, the children hung about the
ruinous gate that shut them out from the twenty-yard strip of garden
which led up to Stott&rsquo;s cottage. Curiosity was the dominant
emotion. Any excuse was good enough to make friendly overtures, but the
babe remained invisible to all save Mrs. Reade; and the village
community kept open ears while the lust of its eyes remained, perforce,
unsatisfied. If Stott&rsquo;s gate slammed in the wind, every door that
commanded a view of that gate was opened, and heads appeared, and bare
arms&mdash;the indications of women who nodded to each other, shook
their heads, pursed their lips and withdrew for the time to attend the
pressure of household duty. Later, even that gate <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87" name="pb87">87</a>]</span>slamming
would reinvigorate the gossip of backyards and front doorways.</p>
<p>The first stranger to force an entry was the rector. He was an
Oxford man who, in his youth, had been an ardent disciple of the school
that attempts the reconciliation of Religion and Science. He had been
ambitious, but nature had predetermined his career by giving him a head
of the wrong shape. At Oxford his limitations had not been clearly
defined, and on the strength of a certain speech at the Union, he crept
into a London west-end curacy. There he attempted to demonstrate the
principle of reconciliation from the pulpit, but his vicar and his
bishop soon recognised that excellent as were his intentions, he was
doing better service to agnosticism than to his own religion. In
consequence he was vilely marooned on the savage island of
Stoke-Underhill, where he might preach as much science as he would to
the natives, for there was no fear of their comprehending him. Fifteen
years of Stoke had brought about a reaction. Nature had made him a
feeble fanatic, and he was now as ardent an opponent of science as he
had once been a defender. In his little mind he believed that his early
reading had enabled him to understand all the weaknesses of the
scientific position. His name was Percy Crashaw.</p>
<p>Mrs. Stott could not deny her rector the right of entry, and he
insisted on seeing the infant, who was <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb88" href="#pb88" name="pb88">88</a>]</span>not yet baptised&mdash;a
shameful neglect, according to Crashaw, for the child was nearly six
weeks old. Nor had Mrs. Stott been &ldquo;churched.&rdquo; Crashaw had
good excuse for pressing his call.</p>
<p>Mrs. Stott refused to face the village. She knew that the place was
all agape, eager to stare at what they considered some &ldquo;new kind
of idiot.&rdquo; Let them wait, was Ellen Mary&rsquo;s attitude. Her
pride was a later development. In those early weeks she feared
criticism.</p>
<p>But she granted Crashaw&rsquo;s request to see the child, and after
the interview (the term is precise) the rector gave way on the question
of a private ceremony, though he had indignantly opposed the scheme
when it was first mooted. It may be that he conceived an image of
himself with that child in his arms, the cynosure of a packed
congregation&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Crashaw was one of the influences that hastened the Stotts&rsquo;
departure from Stoke. He was so indiscreet. After the christening he
would talk. His attitude is quite comprehensible. He, the lawgiver of
Stoke, had been thwarted. He had to find apology for the private
baptism he had denied to many a sickly infant. Moreover, the Stotts had
broken another of his ordinances, for father and mother had stood as
god-parents to their own child, and Crashaw himself had been the second
godfather ordained as necessary by the rubric. He had <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89" name="pb89">89</a>]</span>given
way on these important points so weakly; he had to find excuse, and he
talked himself into a false belief with regard to the child he had
baptised.</p>
<p>He began with his wife. &ldquo;I would allow more latitude to
medical men,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;In such a case as this child of the
Stotts, for instance; it becomes a burden on the community, I might say
a danger, yes, a positive danger. I am not sure whether I was right in
administering the holy sacrament of baptism&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Percy! Surely &hellip;&rdquo; began Mrs. Crashaw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One moment, my dear,&rdquo; protested the rector, &ldquo;I
have not fully explained the circumstances of the case.&rdquo; And as
he warmed to his theme the image of Victor Stott grew to a fearful
grotesqueness. It loomed as a threat over the community and the church.
Crashaw quoted, inaccurately, statistics of the growth of lunacy, and
then went off at a tangent into the theory of possession by evil
spirits. Since his rejection of science, he had lapsed into certain
forms of medi&aelig;valism, and he now began to dally with a theory of
a malign incarnation which he elaborated until it became an article of
his faith.</p>
<p>To his poorer parishioners he spoke in vague terms, but he changed
their attitude; he filled them with overawed terror. They were
intensely curious still, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href=
"#pb90" name="pb90">90</a>]</span>but, now, when the gate was slammed,
one saw a face pressed to the window, the door remained fast; and the
children no longer clustered round that gate, but dared each other to
run past it; which they did, the girls with a scream, the boys with a
jeering &ldquo;Yah&mdash;ah!&rdquo; a boast of intrepidity.</p>
<p>This change of temper was soon understood by the persons most
concerned. Stott grumbled and grew more morose. He had never been
intimate with the villagers, and now he avoided any intercourse with
them. His wife kept herself aloof, and her child sheltered from profane
observation. Naturally, this attitude of the Stotts fostered suspicion.
Even the hardiest sceptic in the taproom of the Challis Arms began to
shake his head, to concede that there &ldquo;moight be soomething in
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet the departure from Stoke might have been postponed indefinitely,
if it had not been for another intrusion. Both Stott and his wife were
ready to take up a new idea, but they were slow to conceive it.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The intruder was the local magnate, the landlord of
Stoke, Wenderby, Chilborough, a greater part of Ailesworth, two or
three minor parishes, and, incidentally, of Pym.</p>
<p>This magnate, Henry Challis, was a man of some <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91" name=
"pb91">91</a>]</span>scholarship, whose ambition had been smothered by
the heaviness of his possessions. He had a remarkably fine library at
Challis Court, but he made little use of it, for he spent the greater
part of his time in travel. In appearance he was rather an ungainly
man; his great head and the bulk of his big shoulders were something
too heavy for his legs.</p>
<p>Crashaw regarded his patron with mixed feelings. For Challis, the
man of property, the man of high connections, of intimate associations
with the world of science and letters, Crashaw had a feeling of awed
respect; but in private he inveighed against the wickedness of Challis,
the agnostic, the decadent.</p>
<p>When Victor Stott was nearly three months old, the rector met his
patron one day on the road between Chilborough and Stoke. It was three
years since their last meeting, and Crashaw noticed that in the
interval Challis&rsquo;s pointed beard had become streaked with
grey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hallo! How d&rsquo;ye do, Crashaw?&rdquo; was the
squire&rsquo;s casual greeting. &ldquo;How is the Stoke
microcosm?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Crashaw smiled subserviently; he was never quite at his ease in
Challis&rsquo;s presence. &ldquo;Rari nantes in gurgite vasto,&rdquo;
was the tag he found in answer to the question put. However great his
contempt for Challis&rsquo;s way of life, in his presence Crashaw was
often oppressed with a feeling of inferiority, a feeling <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="#pb92" name="pb92">92</a>]</span>which he
fought against but could not subdue. The Latin tag was an attempt to
win appreciation, it represented a boast of equality.</p>
<p>Challis correctly evaluated the rector&rsquo;s attitude; it was with
something of pity in his mind that he turned and walked beside him.</p>
<p>There was but one item of news from Stoke, and it soon came to the
surface. Crashaw phrased his description of Victor Stott in terms other
than those he used in speaking to his wife or to his parishioners; but
the undercurrent of his virulent superstition did not escape Challis,
and the attitude of the villagers was made perfectly plain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hm!&rdquo; was Challis&rsquo;s comment, when the flow of
words ceased, &ldquo;<span lang="la">nigroque simillima cygno</span>,
eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! of course, you sneer at our petty affairs,&rdquo; said
Crashaw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By no means. I should like to see this black swan of
Stoke,&rdquo; replied Challis. &ldquo;Anything so exceptional interests
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt Mrs. Stott would be proud to exhibit the
horror,&rdquo; said Crashaw. He had a gleam of satisfaction in the
thought that even the great Henry Challis might be scared. That would,
indeed, be a triumph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Mrs. Stott has no objection, of course,&rdquo; said
Challis. &ldquo;Shall we go there, now?&rdquo; <span class=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The visit of Henry Challis marked the first advent of
Ellen Mary&rsquo;s pride in the exhibition of her wonder. After the
King and the Royal Family&mdash;superhuman beings, infinitely
remote&mdash;the great landlord of the neighbourhood stood as a symbol
of temporal power to the whole district. The budding socialist of the
taproom might sneer, and make threat that the time was coming when he,
the boaster, and Challis, the landlord, would have equal rights; but in
public the socialist kow-towed to his master with a submission no less
obsequious than that of the humblest conservative on the estate.</p>
<p>Mrs. Stott dropped a deep curtsy when, opening the door to the
autocratic summons of Crashaw&rsquo;s rat-a-tat, she saw the great man
of the district at her threshold. Challis raised his hat. Crashaw did
not imitate his example; he was all officiousness, he had the air of a
chief superintendent of police.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Mrs. Stott, we should like to come in for a few minutes.
Mr. Challis would like to see your child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn the fool!&rdquo; was Challis&rsquo;s thought, but he
gave it less abrupt expression. &ldquo;That is, of course, if it is
quite convenient to you, Mrs. Stott. I can come at some other
time&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href=
"#pb94" name="pb94">94</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Please walk in, sir,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Stott, and curtsied
again as she stood aside.</p>
<p>Superintendent Crashaw led the way&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Challis called again next day, by himself this time; and the day
after he dropped in at six o&rsquo;clock while Mr. and Mrs. Stott were
at tea. He put them at their ease by some magic of his personality, and
insisted that they should continue their meal while he sat among the
collapsed springs of the horsehair armchair. He leaned forward and
swung his stick between his knees as it were a pendulum, and shot out
questions as to the Stotts&rsquo; relations with the neighbours. And
always he had an attentive eye on the cradle that stood near the
fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The neighbours are not highly intelligent, I suspect,&rdquo;
said Challis. &ldquo;Even Mr. Crashaw, I fancy, does not appreciate
the&mdash;peculiarities of the situation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s worse than any,&rdquo; interpolated Stott. Ellen
Mary sat in shadow; there was a new light in her eyes, a foretaste of
glory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! a little narrow, a little dogmatic, no doubt,&rdquo;
replied Challis. &ldquo;I was going to propose that you might prefer to
live at Pym.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much farther for me,&rdquo; muttered Stott. He had mixed with
nobility on the cricket field, and was not overawed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt; but you have other interests to consider,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95" name=
"pb95">95</a>]</span>interests of far greater importance.&rdquo;
Challis shifted his gaze from the cradle, and looked Stott in the face.
&ldquo;I understand that Mrs. Stott does not care to take her child out
in the village. Isn&rsquo;t that so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; replied Ellen, to whom this question was
addressed. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care to make an exhibition of
&rsquo;im.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite right, quite right,&rdquo; went on Challis, &ldquo;but
it is very necessary that the child should have air. I consider it very
necessary, a matter of the first importance that the child should have
air,&rdquo; he repeated. His gaze had shifted back to the cradle again.
The child lay with open eyes, staring up at the ceiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, there is an excellent cottage at Pym which I will have
put in repair for you at once,&rdquo; continued Challis. &ldquo;It is
one of two together, but next door there are only old Metcalfe and his
wife and daughter, who will give you no trouble. And really, Mrs.
Stott,&rdquo; he tore his regard from the cradle for a moment,
&ldquo;there is no reason in the world why you should fear the
attention of your neighbours. Here, in Stoke, I admit, they have been
under a complete misapprehension, but I fancy that there were special
reasons for that. In Pym you will have few neighbours, and you need
not, I&rsquo;m sure, fear their criticism.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href="#pb96" name="pb96">96</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;They got one idiot there, already,&rdquo; Stott remarked
somewhat sulkily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You surely do not regard your own child as likely to develop
into an idiot, Stott!&rdquo; Challis&rsquo;s tone was one of
rebuke.</p>
<p>Stott shifted in his chair and his eyes flickered uncertainly in the
direction of the cradle. &ldquo;Dr. O&rsquo;Connell says
&rsquo;twill,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did he see the child last?&rdquo; asked Challis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not since &rsquo;twere a week old, sir,&rdquo; replied
Ellen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case his authority goes for nothing, and, then, by
the way, I suppose the child has not been vaccinated?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better have that done. Get Walters. I&rsquo;ll make myself
responsible. I&rsquo;ll get him to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Challis left, it was decided that the Stotts should move to
Pym in February.</p>
<p>When the great landowner had gone, Mrs. Stott looked wistfully at
her husband.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t fair to the child, George,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s more than you or any one sees, more than Mr.
Challis, even.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stott stared moodily into the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it won&rsquo;t be so out of the way far for you, at Pym,
with your bike,&rdquo; she continued; &ldquo;and we <i>can&rsquo;t</i>
stop &rsquo;ere.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href=
"#pb97" name="pb97">97</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;We might &rsquo;a took a place in Ailesworth,&rdquo; said
Stott.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;ll be so much &rsquo;ealthier for &rsquo;im up
at Pym,&rdquo; protested Ellen. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be fine air up there
for &rsquo;im.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! <i>&rsquo;im</i>. Yes, all right for
<i>&rsquo;im</i>,&rdquo; said Stott, and spat into the fire. Then he
took his cap and went out. He kept his eyes away from the cradle.</p>

<p class="first">Harvey Walters lived in Wenderby, but his
consulting-rooms were in Harley Street, and he did not practise in his
own neighbourhood; nevertheless he vaccinated Victor Stott to oblige
Challis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; asked Challis a few days later, &ldquo;what do
you make of him, Walters? No clich&eacute;s, now, and no professional
jargon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Candidly, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied Walters, after a
thoughtful interval.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many times have you seen him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four, altogether.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good patient? Healthy flesh and that sort of
thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Splendid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he look you in the eyes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once, only once, the first time I visited the house.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98" name=
"pb98">98</a>]</span></p>
<p>Challis nodded. &ldquo;My own experience, exactly. And did you
return that look of his?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not willingly. It was, I confess, not altogether a pleasant
experience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Challis was silent for a few moments, and it was Walters who took up
the interrogatory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Challis!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you, now, some feeling of, shall I say, distaste for the
child? Do you feel that you have no wish to see it again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it that exactly?&rdquo; parried Challis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If not, what is it?&rdquo; asked Walters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my own case,&rdquo; said Challis, &ldquo;I can find an
analogy only in my attitude towards my &lsquo;head&rsquo; at school. In
his presence I was always intimidated by my consciousness of his
superior learning. I felt unpleasantly ignorant, small, negligible.
Curiously enough, I see something of the same expression of feeling in
the attitude of that feeble Crashaw to myself. Well, one makes an
attempt at self-assertion, a kind of futile bragging; and one knows the
futility of it&mdash;at the time. But, afterwards, one finds excuse and
seeks to belittle the personality and attainment of the person one
feared. At school we did not love the &lsquo;head,&rsquo; and, as
schoolboys will, we were always trying to run him down. &lsquo;Next
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99" name=
"pb99">99</a>]</span>time he rags me, I&rsquo;ll cheek him,&rsquo; was
our usual boast&mdash;but we never did. Let&rsquo;s be honest, Walters,
are not you and I exhibiting much the same attitude towards this
extraordinary child? Didn&rsquo;t he produce the effect upon you that
I&rsquo;ve described? Didn&rsquo;t you have a little of the
&lsquo;fifth form&rsquo; feeling,&mdash;a boy under
examination?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Walters smiled and screwed his mouth on one side. &ldquo;The thing
is so absurd,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is what we used to say at school,&rdquo; replied
Challis.</p>

<p class="first">The Stotts&rsquo; move to Pym was not marked by any
incident. Mrs. Stott and her boy were not unduly stared upon as they
left Stoke&mdash;the children were in school&mdash;and their entry into
the new cottage was uneventful.</p>
<p>They moved on a Thursday. On Sunday morning they had their first
visitor.</p>
<p>He came mooning round the fence that guarded the Stotts&rsquo;
garden from the little lane&mdash;it was hardly more than a footpath.
He had a great shapeless head that waggled heavily on his shoulders,
his eyes were lustreless, and his mouth hung open, frequently his
tongue lagged out. He made strange, inhuman noises.
&ldquo;A-ba-ba,&rdquo; was his nearest approach to speech. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href="#pb100" name="pb100">100</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, George,&rdquo; called Mrs. Stott, &ldquo;look at that.
It&rsquo;s Mrs. &rsquo;Arrison&rsquo;s boy what Mrs. Reade&rsquo;s
spoke about. Now, is &rsquo;e anythink like &hellip;&rdquo; she paused,
&ldquo;any think like &rsquo;im?&rdquo; and she indicated the cradle in
the sitting-room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s &rsquo;e want, &rsquo;angin&rsquo; round
&rsquo;ere?&rdquo; replied Stott, disregarding the comparison.
&ldquo;&rsquo;Ere, get off,&rdquo; he called, and he went into the
garden and picked up a stick.</p>
<p>The idiot shambled away. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href=

<p class="first">The strongest of all habits is that of acquiescence.
It is this habit of submission which explains the admired patience and
long-suffering of the abjectly poor. The lower the individual falls,
the more unconquerable becomes the inertia of mind which interferes
between him and revolt against his condition. All the miseries of the
flesh, even starvation, seem preferable to the making of an effort
great enough to break this habit of submission.</p>
<p>Ginger Stott was not poor. For a man in his station of life he was
unusually well provided for, but in him the habit of acquiescence was
strongly rooted. Before his son was a year old, Stott had grown to
loathe his home, to dread his return to it, yet it did not occur to him
until another year had passed that he could, if he would, set up
another <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href="#pb102" name=
"pb102">102</a>]</span>establishment on his own account; that he could,
for instance, take a room in Ailesworth, and leave his wife and child
in the cottage. For two years he did not begin to think of this idea,
and then it was suddenly forced upon him.</p>
<p>Ever since they had overheard those strangely intelligent
self-communings, the Stotts had been perfectly aware that their
wonderful child could talk if he would. Ellen Mary, pondering that
single expression, had read a world of meaning into her son&rsquo;s
murmurs of &ldquo;learning.&rdquo; In her simple mind she understood
that his deliberate withholding of speech was a reserve against some
strange manifestation.</p>
<p>The manifestation, when it came, was as remarkable as it was
unexpected.</p>
<p>The arm-chair in which Henry Challis had once sat was a valued
possession, dedicated by custom to the sole use of George Stott. Ever
since he had been married, Stott had enjoyed the full and undisputed
use of that chair. Except at his meals, he never sat in any other, and
he had formed a fixed habit of throwing himself into that chair
immediately on his return from his work at the County Ground.</p>
<p>One evening in November, however, when his son was just over two
years old, Stott found his sacred chair occupied. He hesitated a
moment, and then went in to the kitchen to find his wife. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href="#pb103" name="pb103">103</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;That child&rsquo;s in my chair,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Ellen was setting the tray for her husband&rsquo;s tea. &ldquo;Yes
&hellip; I know,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I&mdash;I did mention it,
but &rsquo;e &rsquo;asn&rsquo;t moved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, take &rsquo;im out,&rdquo; ordered Stott, but he
dropped his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does it matter?&rdquo; asked his wife. &ldquo;Tea&rsquo;s
just ready. Time that&rsquo;s done &rsquo;e&rsquo;ll be ready for
&rsquo;is bath.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t you move &rsquo;im?&rdquo; persisted Stott
gloomily. &ldquo;&rsquo;E knows it&rsquo;s my chair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There! kettle&rsquo;s boilin&rsquo;, come in and &rsquo;ave
your tea,&rdquo; equivocated the diplomatic Ellen.</p>
<p>During the progress of the meal, the child still sat quietly in his
father&rsquo;s chair, his little hands resting on his knees, his eyes
wide open, their gaze abstracted, as usual, from all earthly
concerns.</p>
<p>But after tea Stott was heroic. He had reached the limit of his
endurance. One of his deep-seated habits was being broken, and with it
snapped his habit of acquiescence. He rose to his feet and faced his
son with determination, and Stott had a bull-dog quality about him that
was not easily defeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look &rsquo;ere! Get out!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
<i>my</i> chair!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The child very deliberately withdrew his attention from infinity and
regarded the dogged face and set jaw of his father. Stott returned the
stare for the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href="#pb104" name=
"pb104">104</a>]</span>fraction of a second, and then his eyes wavered
and dropped, but he maintained his resolution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You got to get out,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;or I&rsquo;ll lift
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ellen Mary gripped the edge of the table, but she made no attempt to
interfere.</p>
<p>There was a tense, strained silence. Then Stott began to breathe
heavily. He lifted his long arms for a moment and raised his eyes, he
even made a tentative step towards the usurped chair.</p>
<p>The child sat calm, motionless; his eyes were fixed upon his
father&rsquo;s face with a sublime, unalterable confidence.</p>
<p>Stott&rsquo;s arms fell to his sides again, he shuffled his feet.
One more effort he made, a sudden, vicious jerk, as though he would do
the thing quickly and be finished with it; then he shivered, his
resolution broke, and he shambled evasively to the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God damn,&rdquo; he muttered. At the door he turned for an
instant, swore again in the same words, and went out into the
night.</p>
<p>To Stott, moodily pacing the Common, this thing was
incomprehensible, some horrible infraction of the law of normal life,
something to be condemned; altered, if possible. It was unprecedented,
and it was, therefore, wrong, unnatural, diabolic, a violation of the
sound principles which uphold human society. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105" name="pb105">105</a>]</span></p>
<p>To Ellen Mary it was merely a miracle, the foreshadowing of greater
miracles to come. And to her was manifested, also, a minor miracle, for
when his father had gone, the child looked at his mother and gave out
his first recorded utterance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Oo <i>is</i> God?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Ellen Mary tried to explain, but before she had stammered out many
words, her son abstracted his gaze, climbed down out of the chair, and
intimated with his usual grunt that he desired his bath and his
bed.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The depths of Stott were stirred that night. He had
often said that &ldquo;he wouldn&rsquo;t stand it much longer,&rdquo;
but the words were a mere formula: he had never even weighed their
intention. As he paced the Common, he muttered them again to the night,
with new meaning; he saw new possibilities, and saw that they were
practicable. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve &rsquo;ad enough,&rdquo; was his new
phrase, and he added another that evidenced his new attitude.
&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; he said again and again. &ldquo;And why
not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stott&rsquo;s mind was not analytical. He did not examine his
problem, weigh this and that and draw a balanced deduction. He merely
saw a picture of peace and quiet, in a room at Ailesworth, in
convenient <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="#pb106" name=
"pb106">106</a>]</span>proximity to his work (he made an admirable
groundsman and umpire, his work absorbed him) and, perhaps, he
conceived some dim ideal of pleasant evenings spent in the
companionship of those who thought in the same terms as himself; whose
speech was of form, averages, the preparation of wickets, and all the
detail of cricket; who shared in his one interest.</p>
<p>Stott&rsquo;s ambition to have a son and to teach him the mysteries
of his father&rsquo;s success had been dwindling for some time past. On
this night it was finally put aside. Stott&rsquo;s &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
&rsquo;ad enough&rdquo; may be taken to include that frustrated ideal.
No more experiments for him, was the pronouncement that summed up his
decision.</p>
<p>Still there were difficulties. Economically he was free, he could
allow his wife thirty shillings a week, more than enough for her
support and that of her child; but&mdash;what would she say, how would
she take his determination? A determination it was, not a proposal. And
the neighbours, what would they say? Stott anticipated a fuss.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll say I&rsquo;ve married &rsquo;er, and it&rsquo;s my
duty to stay by &rsquo;er,&rdquo; was his anticipation of his
wife&rsquo;s attitude. He did not profess to understand the ways of the
sex, but some rumours of misunderstandings between husbands and wives
of his own class had filtered through his absorption in cricket.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107" name=
"pb107">107</a>]</span></p>
<p>He stumbled home with a mind prepared for dissension.</p>
<p>He found his wife stitching by the fire. The door at the foot of the
stairs was closed. The room presented an aspect of cleanly, cheerful
comfort; but Stott entered with dread, not because he feared to meet
his wife, but because there was a terror sleeping in that house.</p>
<p>His armchair was empty now, but he hesitated before he sat down in
it. He took off his cap and rubbed the seat and back of the chair
vigorously: a child of evil had polluted it, the chair might still hold
enchantment&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve &rsquo;ad enough,&rdquo; was his preface, and
there was no need for any further explanation.</p>
<p>Ellen Mary let her hands fall into her lap, and stared dreamily at
the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry it&rsquo;s come to this, George,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;but it &rsquo;asn&rsquo;t been my fault no more&rsquo;n
it&rsquo;s been your&rsquo;n. Of course I&rsquo;ve seen it
a-comin&rsquo;, and I knowed it <i>&rsquo;ad</i> to be, some time; but
I don&rsquo;t think there need be any &rsquo;ard words over it. I
don&rsquo;t expec&rsquo; you to understand &rsquo;im, no more&rsquo;n I
do myself&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t in nature as you should, but all said
and done, there&rsquo;s no bones broke, and if we &rsquo;ave to part,
there&rsquo;s no reason as we shouldn&rsquo;t part
peaceable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That speech said nearly everything. Afterwards <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108" name="pb108">108</a>]</span>it
was only a question of making arrangements, and in that there was no
difficulty.</p>
<p>Another man might have felt a little hurt, a little neglected by the
absence of any show of feeling on his wife&rsquo;s part, but Stott
passed it by. He was singularly free from all sentimentality; certain
primitive, human emotions seem to have played no part in his character.
At this moment he certainly had no thought that he was being carelessly
treated; he wanted to be free from the oppression of that horror
upstairs&mdash;so he figured it&mdash;and the way was made easy for
him.</p>
<p>He nodded approval, and made no sign of any feeling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall go to-morrer,&rdquo; he said, and then,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll sleep down &rsquo;ere to-night.&rdquo; He indicated
the sofa upon which he had slept for so many nights at Stoke, after his
tragedy had been born to him.</p>
<p>Ellen Mary had said nearly everything, but when she had made up a
bed for her husband in the sitting-room, she paused, candle in hand,
before she bade him good-night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t wish &rsquo;im &rsquo;arm, George,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;&rsquo;E&rsquo;s different from us, and we don&rsquo;t
understand &rsquo;im proper, but some day&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wish &rsquo;im no &rsquo;arm,&rdquo; replied
Stott, and shuddered. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wish &rsquo;im no
&rsquo;arm,&rdquo; he repeated, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb109"
href="#pb109" name="pb109">109</a>]</span>as he kicked off the boot he
had been unlacing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mayn&rsquo;t never see &rsquo;im again,&rdquo; added
Ellen Mary.</p>
<p>Stott stood upright. In his socks, he looked noticeably shorter than
his wife. &ldquo;I suppose not,&rdquo; he said, and gave a deep sigh of
relief. &ldquo;Well, thank Gawd for that, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ellen Mary drew her lips together. For some dim, unrealised reason,
she wished her husband to leave the cottage with a feeling of goodwill
towards the child, but she saw that her wish was little likely to be
fulfilled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, good-night, George,&rdquo; she said, after a few
seconds of silence, and she added pathetically, as she turned at the
foot of the stairs: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t wish &rsquo;im no
harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; was all the assurance she received.</p>
<p>When she had gone, and the door was closed behind her, Stott padded
silently to the window and looked out. A young moon was dipping into a
bank of cloud, and against the feeble brightness he could see an
uncertain outline of bare trees. He pulled the curtain across the
window, and turned back to the warm cheerfulness of the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shan&rsquo;t never see &rsquo;im again,&rdquo; he murmured,
&ldquo;thank Gawd!&rdquo; He undressed quietly, blew out the lamp and
got between the sheets of his improvised <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb110" href="#pb110" name="pb110">110</a>]</span>bed. For some minutes
he stared at the leaping shadows on the ceiling. He was wondering why
he had ever been afraid of the child. &ldquo;After all,
&rsquo;e&rsquo;s only a blarsted freak,&rdquo; was the last thought in
his mind before he fell asleep.</p>
<p>With that pronouncement Stott passes out of the history of the
Hampdenshire Wonder. He was in many ways an exceptional man, and his
name will always be associated with the splendid successes of
Hampdenshire cricket, both before and after the accident that destroyed
his career as a bowler. He was not spoiled by his triumphs: those two
years of celebrity never made Stott conceited, and there are
undoubtedly many traits in his character which call for our admiration.
He is still in his prime, an active agent in finding talent for his
county, and in developing that talent when found. Hampdenshire has
never come into the field with weak bowling, and all the credit belongs
to Ginger Stott.</p>
<p>One sees that he was not able to appreciate the wonderful gifts of
his own son, but Stott was an ignorant man, and men of intellectual
attainment failed even as Stott failed in this respect. Ginger Stott
was a success in his own walk of life, and that fact should command our
admiration. It is not for us to judge whether his attainments were more
or less noble than the attainments of his son. <span class=

<p class="first">One morning, two days after Stott had left the
cottage, Ellen Mary was startled by the sudden entrance of her child
into the sitting-room. He toddled in hastily from the garden, and
pointed with excitement through the window.</p>
<p>Ellen Mary was frightened; she had never seen her child other than
deliberate, calm, judicial, in all his movements. In a sudden spasm of
motherly love she bent to pick him up, to caress him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the Wonder, with something that approached
disgust in his tone and attitude. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he repeated.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s &rsquo;e want &rsquo;angin&rsquo; round &rsquo;ere?
Send &rsquo;im off.&rdquo; He pointed again to the window.</p>
<p>Ellen Mary looked out and saw a grinning, slobbering obscenity at
the gate. Stott had scared the idiot away, but in some curious,
inexplicable manner he had learned that his persecutor and enemy had
gone, and he had returned, and had made overtures to the child that
walked so sedately up and down the path of the little garden.</p>
<p>Ellen Mary went out. &ldquo;You be off,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A-ba, a-ba-ba,&rdquo; bleated the idiot, and pointed at the
house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be off, I tell you!&rdquo; said Ellen Mary fiercely. But
still the idiot babbled and pointed. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb112" href="#pb112" name="pb112">112</a>]</span></p>
<p>Ellen Mary stooped to pick up a stick. The idiot blenched; he
understood that movement well enough, though it was a stone he
anticipated, not a stick; with a foolish cry he dropped his arms and
slouched away down the lane. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href=

<p class="first">Challis was out of England for more than three years
after that one brief intrusion of his into the affairs of Mr. and Mrs.
Stott. During the interval he was engaged upon those investigations,
the results of which are embodied in his monograph on the primitive
peoples of the Melanesian Archipelago. It may be remembered that he
followed Dr. W. H. R. Rivers&rsquo; and Dr. C. G. Seligmann&rsquo;s
inquiry into the practice and theory of native customs. Challis
developed his study more particularly with reference to the earlier
evolution of Totemism, and he was able by his patient work among the
Polynesians of Tikopia and Ontong Java, and his comparisons of those
sporadic tribes with the Papuasians of Eastern New Guinea, to correct
some of the inferences with regard to the origins of exogamy made by
Dr. J. G. Frazer in his great work on that subject, published
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href="#pb114" name=
"pb114">114</a>]</span>some years before. A summary of Challis&rsquo;s
argument may be found in vol. li. of the <i>Journal of the Royal
Anthropological Institute</i>.</p>
<p>When he returned to England, Challis shut himself up at Chilborough.
He had engaged a young Cambridge man, Gregory Lewes, as his secretary
and librarian, and the two devoted all their time to planning, writing,
and preparing the monograph referred to.</p>
<p>In such circumstances it is hardly remarkable that Challis should
have completely forgotten the existence of the curious child which had
intrigued his interest nearly four years earlier, and it was not until
he had been back at Challis Court for more than eight months, that the
incursion of Percy Crashaw revived his memory of the phenomenon.</p>
<p>The library at Challis Court occupies a suite of three rooms. The
first and largest of the three is part of the original structure of the
house. Its primitive use had been that of a chapel, a one-storey
building jutting out from the west wing. This Challis had converted
into a very practicable library with a continuous gallery running round
at a height of seven feet from the floor, and in it he had succeeded in
arranging some 20,000 volumes. But as his store of books grew&mdash;and
at one period it had grown very rapidly&mdash;he had been forced to
build, and so he had added first one and then the other of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href="#pb115" name="pb115">115</a>]</span>the
two additional rooms which became necessary. Outside, the wing had the
appearance of an unduly elongated chapel, as he had continued the
original roof over his addition, and copied the style of the old chapel
architecture. The only external alteration he had made had been the
lowering of the sills of the windows.</p>
<p>It was in the furthest of these three rooms that Challis and his
secretary worked, and it was from here that they saw the gloomy figure
of the Rev. Percy Crashaw coming up the drive.</p>
<p>This was the third time he had called. His two former visits had
been unrewarded, but that morning a letter had come from him, couched
in careful phrases, the purport of which had been a request for an
interview on a &ldquo;matter of some moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Challis frowned, and rose from among an ordered litter of
manuscripts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall have to see this man,&rdquo; he said to Lewes, and
strode hastily out of the library.</p>
<p>Crashaw was perfunctorily apologetic, and Challis, looking somewhat
out of place, smoking a heavy wooden pipe in the disused, bleak
drawing-room, waited, almost silent, until his visitor should come to
the point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip; and the&mdash;er&mdash;matter of some moment, I
mentioned,&rdquo; Crashaw mumbled on, &ldquo;is, I should <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href="#pb116" name="pb116">116</a>]</span>say,
not altogether irrelevant to the work you are at present engaged
upon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; commented Challis, with a lift of his thick
eyebrows, &ldquo;no Polynesians come to settle in Stoke, I
trust?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On broad lines, relevant on broad, anthropological lines, I
mean,&rdquo; said Crashaw.</p>
<p>Challis grunted. &ldquo;Go on!&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may remember that curious&mdash;er&mdash;abnormal child
of the Stotts?&rdquo; asked Crashaw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stotts? Wait a minute. Yes! Curious infant with an abnormally
intelligent expression and the head of a hydrocephalic?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Crashaw nodded. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s development has upset me in a most
unusual way,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;I must confess that I am
entirely at a loss, and I really believe that you are the only person
who can give me any intelligent assistance in the matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good of you,&rdquo; murmured Challis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said Crashaw, warming to his subject and
interlacing his fingers, &ldquo;I happen, by the merest accident, I may
say, to be the child&rsquo;s godfather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! you have responsibilities!&rdquo; commented Challis, with
the first glint of amusement in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have,&rdquo; said Crashaw, &ldquo;undoubtedly I
have.&rdquo; He leaned forward with his hands still clasped together,
and rested his forearms on his thighs. As <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb117" href="#pb117" name="pb117">117</a>]</span>he talked he worked
his hands up and down from the wrists, by way of emphasis. &ldquo;I am
aware,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;that on one point I can expect little
sympathy from you, but I make an appeal to you, nevertheless, as a man
of science and&mdash;and a magistrate; for &hellip; for
assistance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused and looked up at Challis, received a nod of encouragement
and developed his grievance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to have the child certified as an idiot, and sent to
an asylum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On what grounds?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is undoubtedly lacking mentally,&rdquo; said Crashaw,
&ldquo;and his influence is, or may be, malignant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Explain,&rdquo; suggested Challis.</p>
<p>For a few seconds Crashaw paused, intent on the pattern of the
carpet, and working his hands slowly. Challis saw that the man&rsquo;s
knuckles were white, that he was straining his hands together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has denied God,&rdquo; he said at last with great
solemnity.</p>
<p>Challis rose abruptly, and went over to the window; the next words
were spoken to his back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have, myself, heard this infant of four years use the most
abhorrent blasphemy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Challis had composed himself. &ldquo;Oh! I say; that&rsquo;s
bad,&rdquo; he said as he turned towards the room again. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href="#pb118" name="pb118">118</a>]</span></p>
<p>Crashaw&rsquo;s head was still bowed. &ldquo;And whatever may be
your own philosophic doubts,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I think you will
agree with me that in such a case as this, something should be done. To
me it is horrible, most horrible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you give me any details?&rdquo; asked
Challis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are most repugnant to me,&rdquo; answered Crashaw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite, quite! I understand. But if you want any
assistance&#8202;&hellip;. Or do you expect me to
investigate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought it my duty, as his godfather, to see to the
child&rsquo;s spiritual welfare,&rdquo; said Crashaw, ignoring the
question put to him, &ldquo;although he is not, now, one of my
parishioners. I first went to Pym some few months ago, but the mother
interposed between me and the child. I was not permitted to see him. It
was not until a few weeks back that I met him&mdash;on the Common;
alone. Of course, I recognised him at once. He is quite
unmistakable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo; prompted Challis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I spoke to him, and he replied with, with&mdash;an abstracted
air, without looking at me. He has not the appearance in any way of a
normal child. I made a few ordinary remarks to him, and then I asked
him if he knew his catechism. He replied that he did not know the word
&lsquo;catechism.&rsquo; I <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href=
"#pb119" name="pb119">119</a>]</span>may mention that he speaks the
dialect of the common people, but he has a much larger vocabulary. His
mother has taught him to read, it appears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He seems to have a curiously apt intelligence,&rdquo;
interpolated Challis.</p>
<p>Crashaw wrung his clasped hands and put the comment on one side.
&ldquo;I then spoke to him of some of the broad principles of the
Church&rsquo;s teaching,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;He listened
quietly, without interruption, and when I stopped, he prompted me with
questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One minute!&rdquo; said Challis. &ldquo;Tell me; what sort of
questions? That is most important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not remember precisely,&rdquo; returned Crashaw,
&ldquo;but one, I think, was as to the sources of the Bible. I did not
read anything beyond simple and somewhat unusual curiosity into those
questions, I may say&#8202;&hellip;. I talked to him for some
considerable time&mdash;I dare say for more than an
hour&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No signs of idiocy, apparently, during all this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I consider it less a case of idiocy than one of possession,
maleficent possession,&rdquo; replied Crashaw. He did not see his
host&rsquo;s grim smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, and the blasphemy?&rdquo; prompted Challis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the end of my instruction, the child, still looking away
from me, shook his head and said that what I had told him was not true,
I confess that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href="#pb120" name=
"pb120">120</a>]</span>I was staggered. Possibly I lost my temper,
somewhat. I may have grown rather warm in my speech. And at
last&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo; Crashaw clenched his hands and spoke in
such a low voice that Challis could hardly hear him. &ldquo;At last he
turned to me and said things which I could not possibly repeat, which I
pray that I may never hear again from the mouth of any living
being.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Profanities, obscenities, er&mdash;swear-words,&rdquo;
suggested Challis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blasphemy, <i>blasphemy</i>,&rdquo; cried Crashaw. &ldquo;Oh!
I wonder that I did not injure the child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Challis moved over to the window again. For more than a minute there
was silence in that big, neglected-looking room. Then Crashaw&rsquo;s
feelings began to find vent in words, in a long stream of insistent
asseverations, pitched on a rising note that swelled into a diapason of
indignation. He spoke of the position and power of his Church, of its
influence for good among the uneducated, agricultural population among
which he worked. He enlarged on the profound necessity for a living
religion among the poorer classes; and on the revolutionary tendency
towards socialism, which would be encouraged if the great restraining
power of a creed that enforced subservience to temporal power was once
shaken. And, at last, he brought his arguments to a head by saying that
the example of a child of four <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb121"
href="#pb121" name="pb121">121</a>]</span>years old, openly defying a
minister of the Church, and repudiating the very conception of the
Deity, was an example which might produce a profound effect upon the
minds of a slow-thinking people; that such an example might be the
leaven which would leaven the whole lump; and that for the welfare of
the whole neighbourhood it was an instant necessity that the child
should be put under restraint, his tongue bridled, and any opportunity
to proclaim his blasphemous doctrines forcibly denied to him. Long
before he had concluded, Crashaw was on his feet, pacing the room,
declaiming, waving his arms.</p>
<p>Challis stood, unanswering, by the window. He did not seem to hear;
he did not even shrug his shoulders. Not till Crashaw had brought his
argument to a culmination, and boomed into a dramatic silence, did
Challis turn and look at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you cannot confine a child in an asylum on those
grounds,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;the law does not permit it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Church is above the law,&rdquo; replied Crashaw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in these days,&rdquo; said Challis; &ldquo;it is by law
established!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Crashaw began to speak again, but Challis waved him down.
&ldquo;Quite, quite. I see your point,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I
must see this child myself. Believe me, I will see what can be done. I
will, at least, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href="#pb122"
name="pb122">122</a>]</span>try to prevent his spreading his opinions
among the yokels.&rdquo; He smiled grimly. &ldquo;I quite agree with
you that that is a consummation which is not to be desired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will see him soon?&rdquo; asked Crashaw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-day,&rdquo; returned Challis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you will let me see you again, afterwards?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Crashaw still hesitated for a moment. &ldquo;I might, perhaps, come
with you,&rdquo; he ventured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On no account,&rdquo; said Challis.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Gregory Lewes was astonished at the long absence of
his chief; he was more astonished when his chief returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to come up with me to Pym, Lewes,&rdquo; said
Challis; &ldquo;one of my tenants has been confounding the rector of
Stoke. It is a matter that must be attended to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lewes was a fair-haired, hard-working young man, with a bent for
science in general that had not yet crystallised into any special
study. He had a curious sense of humour, that proved something of an
obstacle in the way of specialisation. He did not take Challis&rsquo;s
speech seriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going as a magistrate?&rdquo; he asked; &ldquo;or is
it a matter for scientific investigation?&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb123" href="#pb123" name="pb123">123</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Both,&rdquo; said Challis. &ldquo;Come along!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you serious, sir?&rdquo; Lewes still doubted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Intensely. I&rsquo;ll explain as we go,&rdquo; said
Challis.</p>
<p>It is not more than a mile and a half from Challis Court to Pym. The
nearest way is by a cart track through the beech woods, that winds up
the hill to the Common. In winter this track is almost impassable, over
boot-top in heavy mud; but the early spring had been fairly dry, and
Challis chose this route.</p>
<p>As they walked, Challis went through the early history of Victor
Stott, so far as it was known to him. &ldquo;I had forgotten the
child,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I thought it would die. You see, it is by
way of being an extraordinary freak of nature. It has, or had, a
curious look of intelligence. You must remember that when I saw it, it
was only a few months old. But even then it conveyed in some
inexplicable way a sense of power. Every one felt it. There was Harvey
Walters, for instance&mdash;he vaccinated it; I made him confess that
the child made him feel like a school-boy. Only, you understand, it had
not spoken then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What conveyed that sense of power?&rdquo; asked Lewes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The way it had of looking at you, staring you out of
countenance, sizing you up and rejecting you. It did that, I give you
my word; it did all that at a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb124"
href="#pb124" name="pb124">124</a>]</span>few months old, and without
the power of speech. Only, you see, I thought it was merely a freak of
some kind, some abnormality that disgusted one in an unanalysed way.
And I thought it would die. I certainly thought it would die. I am most
eager to see this new development.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t heard. It confounded Crashaw, you say? And it
cannot be more than four or five years old now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four; four and a half,&rdquo; returned Challis, and then the
conversation was interrupted by the necessity of skirting a tiny morass
of wet leaf-mould that lay in a hollow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confounded Crashaw? I should think so,&rdquo; Challis went
on, when they had found firm going again. &ldquo;The good man would not
soil his devoted tongue by any condescension to oratio recta, but I
gathered that the child had made light of his divine
authority.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great C&aelig;sar!&rdquo; ejaculated Lewes; &ldquo;but that
is immense. What did Crashaw do&mdash;shake him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; he certainly did not lay hands on him at all. His own
expression was that he did not know how it was he did not do the child
an injury. That is one of the things that interest me enormously. That
power I spoke of must have been retained. Crashaw must have been blue
with anger; he could hardly repeat the story to me, he was so agitated.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href="#pb125" name=
"pb125">125</a>]</span>It would have surprised me less if he had told
me he had murdered the child. That I could have understood,
perfectly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is, of course, quite incomprehensible to me, as
yet,&rdquo; commented Lewes.</p>
<p>When they came out of the woods on to the stretch of common from
which you can see the great swelling undulations of the Hampden Hills,
Challis stopped. A spear of April sunshine had pierced the load of
cloud towards the west, and the bank of wood behind them gave shelter
from the cold wind that had blown fiercely all the afternoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a fine prospect,&rdquo; said Challis, with a sweep of
his hand. &ldquo;I sometimes feel, Lewes, that we are over-intent on
our own little narrow interests. Here are you and I, busying ourselves
in an attempt to throw some little light&mdash;a very little it must
be&mdash;on some petty problems of the origin of our race. We are
looking downwards, downwards always; digging in old muck-heaps; raking
up all kinds of unsavoury rubbish to prove that we are born out of the
dirt. And we have never a thought for the future in all our
work,&mdash;a future that may be glorious, who knows? Here, perhaps in
this village, insignificant from most points of view, but set in a
country that should teach us to raise our eyes from the ground; here,
in this tiny hamlet, is living a child who may become a greater than
Socrates or <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href="#pb126" name=
"pb126">126</a>]</span>Shakespeare, a child who may revolutionise our
conceptions of time and space. There have been great men in the past
who have done that, Lewes; there is no reason for us to doubt that
still greater men may succeed them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; there is no reason for us to doubt that,&rdquo; said
Lewes, and they walked on in silence towards the Stotts&rsquo;
cottage.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Challis knocked and walked in. They found Ellen Mary
and her son at the tea-table.</p>
<p>The mother rose to her feet and dropped a respectful curtsy. The boy
glanced once at Gregory Lewes and then continued his meal as if he were
unaware of any strange presence in the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. I am afraid we are interrupting you,&rdquo;
Challis apologised. &ldquo;Pray sit down, Mrs. Stott, and go on with
your tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir. I&rsquo;d just finished, sir,&rdquo; said
Ellen Mary, and remained standing with an air of quiet deference.</p>
<p>Challis took the celebrated armchair, and motioned Lewes to the
window-sill, the nearest available seat for him. &ldquo;Please sit
down, Mrs. Stott,&rdquo; he said, and Ellen Mary sat,
apologetically.</p>
<p>The boy pushed his cup towards his mother, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb127" href="#pb127" name=
"pb127">127</a>]</span>pointed to the teapot; he made a grunting sound
to attract her attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll excuse me, sir,&rdquo; murmured Ellen Mary, and
she refilled the cup and passed it back to her son, who received it
without any acknowledgment. Challis and Lewes were observing the boy
intently, but he took not the least notice of their scrutiny. He
discovered no trace of self-consciousness; Henry Challis and Gregory
Lewes appeared to have no place in the world of his abstraction.</p>
<p>The figure the child presented to his two observers was worthy of
careful scrutiny.</p>
<p>At the age of four and a half years, the Wonder was bald, save for a
few straggling wisps of reddish hair above the ears and at the base of
the skull, and a weak, sparse down, of the same colour, on the crown.
The eyebrows, too, were not marked by any line of hair, but the
eyelashes were thick, though short, and several shades darker than the
hair on the skull.</p>
<p>The face is not so easily described. The mouth and chin were
relatively small, overshadowed by that broad cliff of forehead, but
they were firm, the chin well moulded, the lips thin and compressed.
The nose was unusual when seen in profile. There was no sign of a bony
bridge, but it was markedly curved and jutted out at a curious angle
from the line of the face. The nostrils were wide and open. None
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb128" href="#pb128" name=
"pb128">128</a>]</span>of these features produced any effect of
childishness; but this effect was partly achieved by the contours of
the cheeks, and by the fact that there was no indication of any lines
on the face.</p>
<p>The eyes nearly always wore their usual expression of abstraction.
It was very rarely that the Wonder allowed his intelligence to be
exhibited by that medium. When he did, the effect was strangely
disconcerting, blinding. One received an impression of extraordinary
concentration: it was as though for an instant the boy was able to give
one a glimpse of the wonderful force of his intellect. When he looked
one in the face with intention, and suddenly allowed one to realise, as
it were, all the dominating power of his brain, one shrank into
insignificance, one felt as an ignorant, intelligent man may feel when
confronted with some elaborate theorem of the higher mathematics.
&ldquo;Is it possible that any one can really understand these
things?&rdquo; such a man might think with awe, and in the same way one
apprehended some vast, inconceivable possibilities of mind-function
when the Wonder looked at one with, as I have said, intention.</p>
<p>He was dressed in a little jacket-suit, and wore a linen collar; the
knickerbockers, loose and badly cut, fell a little below the knees. His
stockings were of worsted, his boots clumsy and thick-soled, though
relatively tiny. One had the impression always that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb129" href="#pb129" name="pb129">129</a>]</span>his
body was fragile and small, but as a matter of fact the body and limbs
were, if anything, slightly better developed than those of the average
child of four and a half years.</p>
<p>Challis had ample opportunity to make these observations at various
periods. He began them as he sat in the Stotts&rsquo; cottage. At first
he did not address the boy directly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hear your son has been having a religious controversy with
Mr. Crashaw,&rdquo; was his introduction to the object of his
visit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, sir!&rdquo; Plainly this was not news to Mrs.
Stott.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your son told you?&rdquo; suggested Challis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! no, sir, &rsquo;e never told me,&rdquo; replied Mrs.
Stott, &ldquo;&rsquo;twas Mr. Crashaw. &rsquo;E&rsquo;s been &rsquo;ere
several times lately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Challis looked sharply at the boy, but he gave no sign that he heard
what was passing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; Mr. Crashaw seems rather upset about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, sir, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; speak plainly,&rdquo; prompted Challis. &ldquo;I assure
you, that you will have no cause to regret any confidence you may make
to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see as it&rsquo;s any business of Mr.
Crashaw&rsquo;s, sir, if you&rsquo;ll forgive me for sayin&rsquo;
so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has been worrying you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;E &rsquo;as, sir, but &rsquo;e &hellip;&rdquo; she
glanced at her son&mdash;<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href=
"#pb130" name="pb130">130</a>]</span>she laid a stress on the pronoun
always when she spoke of him that differentiated its
significance&mdash;&ldquo;&rsquo;e &rsquo;asn&rsquo;t seen Mr. Crashaw
again, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Challis turned to the boy. &ldquo;You are not interested in Mr.
Crashaw, I suppose?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>The boy took no notice of the question.</p>
<p>Challis was piqued. If this extraordinary child really had an
intelligence, surely it must be possible to appeal to that intelligence
in some way. He made another effort, addressing Mrs. Stott.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we must forgive Mr. Crashaw, you know, Mrs. Stott. As
I understand it, your boy at the age of four years and a half has
defied&mdash;his cloth, if I may say so.&rdquo; He paused, and as he
received no answer, continued: &ldquo;But I hope that matter may be
easily arranged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; said Mrs. Stott. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
very kind of you. I&rsquo;m sure, I&rsquo;m greatly obliged to you,
sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s only one reason of my visit to you,
however.&rdquo; Challis hesitated. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been wondering
whether I might not be able to help you and your son in some other way.
I understand that he has unusual power of&mdash;of
intelligence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed &rsquo;e &rsquo;as, sir,&rdquo; responded Mrs.
Stott.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he can read, can&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve learned &rsquo;im what I could, sir: it
isn&rsquo;t much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, perhaps I could lend him a few books.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href="#pb131" name=
"pb131">131</a>]</span></p>
<p>Challis made a significant pause, and again he looked at the boy;
but there was no response, so he continued: &ldquo;Tell me what he has
read.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve no books, sir, and we never &rsquo;ardly see a
paper now. All we &rsquo;ave in the &rsquo;ouse is a Bible and two
copies of Lillywhite&rsquo;s cricket annual as my &rsquo;usband left
be&rsquo;ind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Challis smiled. &ldquo;Has he read those?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Bible &rsquo;e &rsquo;as, I believe,&rdquo; replied Mrs.
Stott.</p>
<p>It was a conversation curious in its impersonality. Challis was
conscious of the anomaly that he was speaking in the boy&rsquo;s
presence, crediting him with a remarkable intelligence, and yet
addressing a frankly ignorant woman as though the boy was not in the
room. Yet how could he break that deliberate silence? It seemed to him
as though there must, after all, be some mistake; yet how account for
Crashaw&rsquo;s story if the boy were indeed an idiot?</p>
<p>With a slight show of temper he turned to the Wonder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want to read?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I have between
forty and fifty thousand books in my library. I think it possible that
you might find one or two which would interest you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Wonder lifted his hand as though to ask for silence. For a
minute, perhaps, no one spoke. All <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb132"
href="#pb132" name="pb132">132</a>]</span>waited, expectant; Challis
and Lewes with intent eyes fixed on the detached expression of the
child&rsquo;s face, Ellen Mary with bent head. It was a strange, yet
very logical question that came at last:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What should I learn out of all them books?&rdquo; asked the
Wonder. He did not look at Challis as he spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A difficult question, that, Lewes,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Lewes lifted his eyebrows and pulled at his fair moustache.
&ldquo;If you take the question literally,&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might learn&mdash;the essential part &hellip; of all the

Challis. He phrased his sentence carefully, as though he were afraid of

<p>&ldquo;Should I learn what I am?&rdquo; asked the Wonder.</p>
<p>Challis understood the question in its metaphysical acceptation. He
had the sense of a powerful but undirected intelligence working from
the simple <span class="corr" id="xd26e2325" title=
"Source: premisses">premises</span> of experience; of a cloistered mind
that had functioned profoundly; a mind unbound by the tradition of all
the speculations and discoveries of man, the essential conclusions of
which were contained in that library at Challis Court.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; said Challis, after a perceptible interval,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href="#pb133" name=
"pb133">133</a>]</span>&ldquo;that you will not learn from any books in
my possession, but you will find grounds for speculation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grounds for speculation?&rdquo; questioned the Wonder. He
repeated the words quite clearly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Material&mdash;matter from which you
can&mdash;er&mdash;formulate theories of your own,&rdquo; explained
Challis.</p>
<p>The Wonder shook his head. It was evident that Challis&rsquo;s
sentence conveyed little or no meaning to him.</p>
<p>He got down from his chair and took up an old cricket cap of his
father&rsquo;s, a cap which his mother had let out by the addition of
another gore of cloth that did not match the original material. He
pulled this cap carefully over his bald head, and then made for the
door.</p>
<p>At the threshold the strange child paused, and without looking at
any one present said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll coom to your library,&rdquo;
and went out.</p>
<p>Challis joined Lewes at the window, and they watched the boy make
his deliberate way along the garden path and up the lane towards the
fields beyond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You let him go out by himself?&rdquo; asked Challis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He likes to be in the air, sir,&rdquo; replied Ellen
Mary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you have to let him go his own way?&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href="#pb134" name=
"pb134">134</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will send the governess cart up for him to-morrow
morning,&rdquo; said Challis, &ldquo;at ten o&rsquo;clock. That is, of
course, if you have no objection to his coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;E said &rsquo;e&rsquo;d coom, sir,&rdquo; replied
Ellen Mary. Her tone implied that there was no appeal possible against
her son&rsquo;s statement of his wishes.</p>

<p class="first">&ldquo;His methods do not lack terseness,&rdquo;
remarked Lewes, when he and Challis were out of earshot of the
cottage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His methods and manners are damnable,&rdquo; said Challis,
&ldquo;but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were going to say?&rdquo; prompted Lewes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what is your opinion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not convinced, as yet,&rdquo; said Lewes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, surely,&rdquo; expostulated Challis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not from objective, personal evidence. Let us put Crashaw out
of our minds for the moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well; go on, state your case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has, so far, made four remarks in our presence,&rdquo;
said Lewes, gesticulating with his walking stick. &ldquo;Two of them
can be neglected; his repetition of your words, which he did not
understand, and his condescending promise to study your
library.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I&rsquo;m with you, so far.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb135" href="#pb135" name="pb135">135</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, putting aside the preconception with which we entered
the cottage, was there really anything in the other two remarks? Were
they not the type of simple, unreasoning questions which one may often
hear from the mouth of a child of that age? &lsquo;What shall I learn
from your books?&rsquo; Well, it is the natural question of the
ignorant child, who has no conception of the contents of books, no
experience which would furnish material for his imagination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The second remark is more explicable still. It is a remark we
all make in childhood, in some form or another. I remember quite well
at the age of six or seven asking my mother: &lsquo;Which is me, my
soul or my body?&rsquo; I was brought up on the Church catechism. But
you at once accepted these questions&mdash;which, I maintain, were
questions possible in the mouth of a simple, ignorant child&mdash;in
some deep, metaphysical acceptation. Don&rsquo;t you think, sir, we
should wait for further evidence before we attribute any phenomenal
intelligence to this child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite the right attitude to take, Lewes&mdash;the scientific
attitude,&rdquo; replied Challis. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go by the
lane,&rdquo; he added, as they reached the entrance to the wood.</p>
<p>For some few minutes they walked in silence; Challis with his head
down, his heavy shoulders <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href=
"#pb136" name="pb136">136</a>]</span>humped. His hands were clasped
behind him, dragging his stick as it were a tail, which he occasionally
cocked. He walked with a little stumble now and again, his eyes on the
ground. Lewes strode with a sure foot, his head up, and he slashed at
the tangle of last year&rsquo;s growth on the bank whenever he passed
some tempting butt for the sword-play of his stick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think, then,&rdquo; said Challis at last, &ldquo;that
much of the atmosphere&mdash;you must have marked the
atmosphere&mdash;of the child&rsquo;s personality, was a creation of
our own minds, due to our preconceptions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think so,&rdquo; Lewes replied, a touch of defiance in
his tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that what you <i>want</i> to believe?&rdquo;
asked Challis.</p>
<p>Lewes hit at a flag of dead bracken and missed. &ldquo;You
mean&#8202;&hellip;?&rdquo; he prevaricated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean that that is a much stronger influence than any
preconception, my dear Lewes. I&rsquo;m no pragmatist, as you know; but
there can be no doubt that with the majority of us the wish to believe
a thing is true constitutes the truth of that thing for us. And that
is, in my opinion, the wrong attitude for either scientist or
philosopher. Now, in the case we are discussing, I suppose, at bottom I
should like to agree with you. One does not like to feel that a child
of four and a half has greater intellectual <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href="#pb137" name=
"pb137">137</a>]</span>powers than oneself. Candidly, I do not like it
at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not! But I can&rsquo;t think
that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can if you try; you would at once if you wished
to,&rdquo; returned Challis, anticipating the completion of
Lewes&rsquo;s sentence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll admit that there are some remarkable facts in the
case of this child,&rdquo; said Lewes, &ldquo;but I do not see why we
should, as yet, take the whole proposition for granted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! I am with you there,&rdquo; returned Challis. And no more
was said until they were nearly home.</p>
<p>Just before they turned into the drive, however, Challis stopped.
&ldquo;Do you know, Lewes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am not sure that I
am doing a wise thing in bringing that child here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lewes did not understand. &ldquo;No, sir? Why not?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, think of the possibilities of that child, if he has all
the powers I credit him with,&rdquo; said Challis. &ldquo;Think of his
possibilities for original thought if he is kept away from all the
traditions of this futile learning.&rdquo; He waved an arm in the
direction of the elongated chapel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! but surely,&rdquo; remonstrated Lewes, &ldquo;that is a
necessary groundwork. Knowledge is built up step by step.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it? I wonder. I sometimes doubt,&rdquo; said <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href="#pb138" name=
"pb138">138</a>]</span>Challis. &ldquo;Yes, I sometimes doubt whether
we have ever learned anything at all that is worth knowing. And,
perhaps, this child, if he were kept away from books&#8202;&hellip;.
However, the thing is done now, and in any case he would never have
been able to dodge the School attendance officer.&rdquo; <span class=

<p class="first">&ldquo;Shall you be able to help me in collating your
notes of the Tikopia observations this morning, sir?&rdquo; Lewes
asked. He rose from the breakfast-table and lit a cigarette. There was
no ceremony between Challis and his secretary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You forget our engagement for ten o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; said
Challis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Need that distract us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It need not, but doesn&rsquo;t it seem to you that it may
furnish us with valuable material?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly pertinent, sir, is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What line do you think of taking up, Lewes?&rdquo; asked
Challis with apparent irrelevance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With regard to this&mdash;this phenomenon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no. I was speaking of your own ambitions.&rdquo; Challis
had sauntered over to the window; he stood, with his back to Lewes,
looking out at the blue and white of the April sky. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href="#pb140" name="pb140">140</a>]</span></p>
<p>Lewes frowned. He did not understand the gist of the question.
&ldquo;I suppose there is a year&rsquo;s work on this book before me
yet,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite, quite,&rdquo; replied Challis, watching a cloud shadow
swarm up the slope of Deane Hill. &ldquo;Yes, certainly a year&rsquo;s
work. I was thinking of the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have thought of laboratory work in connection with
psychology,&rdquo; said Lewes, still puzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I remembered your saying something of the
kind,&rdquo; murmured Challis absently. &ldquo;We are going to have
more rain. It will be a late spring this year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had the question any bearing on our engagement of this
morning?&rdquo; Lewes was a little anxious, uncertain whether this
inquiry as to his future had not some particular significance; a hint,
perhaps, that his services would not be required much longer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I think it had,&rdquo; said Challis. &ldquo;I saw the
governess cart go up the road a few minutes since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose the boy will be here in a quarter of an
hour?&rdquo; said Lewes by way of keeping up the conversation. He was
puzzled; he did not know Challis in this mood. He did not conceive it
possible that Challis could be nervous about the arrival of so
insignificant a person as this Stott child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all very ridiculous,&rdquo; broke out Challis
suddenly; and he turned away from the window, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href="#pb141" name="pb141">141</a>]</span>and
joined Lewes by the fire. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I don&rsquo;t follow you, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Challis laughed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not surprised,&rdquo; he said;
&ldquo;I was a trifle inconsecutive. But I wish you were more
interested in this child, Lewes. The thought of him engrosses me, and
yet I don&rsquo;t want to meet him. I should be relieved to hear that
he wasn&rsquo;t coming. Surely you, as a student of psychology
&hellip;&rdquo; he broke off with a lift of his heavy shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Yes! I <i>am</i> interested, certainly, as you say, as a
student of psychology. We ought to take some measurements. The
configuration of the skull is not abnormal otherwise than in its
relation to the development of the rest of his body, but
&hellip;&rdquo; Lewes meandered off into somewhat abstruse speculation
with regard to the significance of craniology.</p>
<p>Challis nodded his head and murmured: &ldquo;Quite, quite,&rdquo;
occasionally. He seemed glad that Lewes should continue to talk.</p>
<p>The lecture was interrupted by the appearance of the governess
cart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Jove, he <i>has</i> come,&rdquo; ejaculated Challis in the
middle of one of Lewes&rsquo;s periods. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to see
me through this, my boy. I&rsquo;m damned if I know how to take the
child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lewes flushed, annoyed at the interruption of his <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href="#pb142" name=
"pb142">142</a>]</span>lecture. He had believed that he had been
interesting. &ldquo;Curse the kid,&rdquo; was the thought in his mind
as he followed Challis to the window.</p>

<p class="first">Jessop, the groom deputed to fetch the Wonder from
Pym, looked a little uneasy, perhaps a little scared. When he drew up
at the porch, the child pointed to the door of the cart and indicated
that it was to be opened for him. He was evidently used to being waited
upon. When this command had been obeyed, he descended deliberately and
then pointed to the front door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open!&rdquo; he said clearly, as Jessop hesitated. The Wonder
knew nothing of bells or ceremony.</p>
<p>Jessop came down from the cart and rang.</p>
<p>The butler opened the door. He was an old servant and accustomed to
his master&rsquo;s eccentricities, but he was not prepared for the
vision of that strange little figure, with a large head in a
parti-coloured cricket-cap, an apparition that immediately walked
straight by him into the hall, and pointed to the first door he came
to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear! Well, to be sure,&rdquo; gasped Heathcote.
&ldquo;Why, whatever&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open!&rdquo; commanded the Wonder, and Heathcote obeyed,
weak-kneed. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb143" href="#pb143" name=
"pb143">143</a>]</span></p>
<p>The door chanced to be the right one, the door of the
breakfast-room, and the Wonder walked in, still wearing his cap.</p>
<p>Challis came forward to meet him with a conventional greeting.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you were able to come &hellip;&rdquo; he began,
but the child took no notice; he looked rapidly round the room, and not
finding what he wanted, signified his desire by a single word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Books,&rdquo; he said, and looked at Challis.</p>
<p>Heathcote stood at the door, hesitating between amazement and
disapproval. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen the like,&rdquo; was how he
phrased his astonishment later, in the servants&rsquo; hall,
&ldquo;never in all my born days. To see that melon-&rsquo;eaded himp
in a cricket-cap hordering the master about. Well,
there&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jessop says he fair got the creeps drivin&rsquo; &rsquo;im
over,&rdquo; said the cook. &ldquo;&rsquo;E says the child&rsquo;s not
right in &rsquo;is &rsquo;ead.&rdquo;</p>

<div id="interlude" class="div0 part">
<h2 class="main">INTERLUDE</h2>
<p class="first">This brief history of the Hampdenshire Wonder is
marked by a stereotyped division into three parts, an arbitrary
arrangement dependent on the experience of the writer. The true
division becomes manifest at this point. The life of Victor Stott was
cut into two distinct sections, between which there is no correlation.
The first part should tell the story of his mind during the life of
experience, the time occupied in observation of the phenomena of life
presented to him in fact, without any specific teaching on the theories
of existence and progress, or on the speculation as to ultimate
destiny. The second part should deal with his entry into the world of
books; into that account of a long series of collated experiments and
partly verified hypotheses we call science; into the imperfectly
developed system of inductive and deductive logic which determines
mathematics and philosophy; into the long, inaccurate and largely
unverifiable account of human blindness and error known as history; and
into the realm of idealism, symbol, and pitiful pride we find in the
story of poetry, letters, and religion. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb146" href="#pb146" name="pb146">146</a>]</span></p>
<p>I will confess that I once contemplated the writing of such a
history. It was Challis who, in his courtly, gentle way, pointed out to
me that no man living had the intellectual capacity to undertake so
profound a work.</p>
<p>For some three months before I had this conversation with Challis, I
had been wrapped in solitude, dreaming, speculating. I had been
uplifted in thought, I had come to believe myself inspired as a result
of my separation from the world of men, and of the deep introspection
and meditation in which I had been plunged. I had arrived at a point,
perhaps not far removed from madness, at which I thought myself capable
of setting out the true history of Victor Stott.</p>
<p>Challis broke the spell. He cleared away the false glamour which was
blinding and intoxicating me, and brought me back to a condition of
open-eyed sanity. To Challis I owe a great debt.</p>
<p>Yet at the moment I was sunk in depression. All the glory of my
vision had faded; the afterglow was quenched in the blackness of the
night that drew out of the east and fell from the zenith as a curtain
of utter darkness.</p>
<p>Again Challis came to my rescue. He brought me a great sheaf of
notes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if you can&rsquo;t write a
true history of that strange child, I see no reason why <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb147" href="#pb147" name="pb147">147</a>]</span>you
should not write his story as it is known to you, as it impinges on
your own life. After all, you, in many ways, know more of him than any
one. You came nearest to receiving his confidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But only during the last few months,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does that matter?&rdquo; said Challis with an upheaval of his
shoulders&mdash;&ldquo;shrug&rdquo; is far too insignificant a word for
that mountainous humping. &ldquo;Is any biography founded on better
material than you have at command?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He unfolded his bundle of notes. &ldquo;See here,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;here is some magnificent material for you&mdash;first-hand
observations made at the time. Can&rsquo;t you construct a story from
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even then I began to cast my story in a slightly biographical form.
I wrote half a dozen chapters, and read them to Challis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Magnificent, my dear fellow,&rdquo; was his comment,
&ldquo;magnificent; but no one will believe it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had been carried away by my own prose, and with the natural vanity
of the author, I resented intensely his criticism.</p>
<p>For some weeks I did not see Challis again, and I persisted in my
futile endeavour, but always as I wrote that killing suggestion
insinuated itself: &ldquo;No one will believe you.&rdquo; At times I
felt as a man may feel who has spent many years in a lunatic asylum,
and after his release is for ever engaged <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb148" href="#pb148" name="pb148">148</a>]</span>in a struggle to
allay the doubts of a leering suspicion.</p>
<p>I gave up the hopeless task at last, and sought out Challis
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Write it as a story,&rdquo; he suggested, &ldquo;and give up
the attempt to carry conviction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And in that spirit, adopting the form of a story, I did begin, and
in that form I hope to finish.</p>
<p>But here as I reach the great division, the determining factor of
Victor Stott&rsquo;s life, I am constrained to pause and apologise. I
have become uncomfortably conscious of my own limitations, and the
feeble, ephemeral methods I am using. I am trifling with a wonderful
story, embroidering my facts with the tawdry detail of my own
imagining.</p>
<p>I saw&mdash;I see&mdash;no other way.</p>
<p>This is, indeed, a preface, yet I prefer to put it in this place,
since it was at this time I wrote it.</p>

<p class="first">Challis led the way to the library; Lewes, petulant
and mutinous, hung in the rear.</p>
<p>The Wonder toddled forward, unabashed, to enter his new world. On
the threshold, however, he paused. His comprehensive stare took in a
sweeping picture of enclosing walls of books, and beyond was a vista of
further rooms, of more walls all lined from floor to ceiling with
records of human discovery, endeavour, doubt, and hope.</p>
<p>The Wonder stayed and stared. Then he took two faltering steps into
the room and stopped again, and, finally, he looked up at Challis with
doubt and question; his gaze no longer quelling and authoritative, but
hesitating, compliant, perhaps a little childlike.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ave you read all these?&rdquo; he asked. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href="#pb152" name="pb152">152</a>]</span></p>
<p>It was a curious picture. The tall figure of Challis, stooping, as
always, slightly forward; Challis, with his seaman&rsquo;s eyes and
scholar&rsquo;s head, his hands loosely clasped together behind his
back, paying such scrupulous attention to that grotesque representative
of a higher intellectuality, clothed in the dress of a villager, a
patched cricket-cap drawn down over his globular skull, his little arms
hanging loosely at his sides; who, nevertheless, even in this new,
strange aspect of unwonted humility bore on his face the promise of
some ultimate development which differentiated him from all other
humanity, as the face of humanity is differentiated from the face of
its prognathous ancestor.</p>
<p>The scene is set in a world of books, and in the background lingers
the athletic figure and fair head of Lewes, the young Cambridge
undergraduate, the disciple of science, hardly yet across the threshold
which divides him from the knowledge of his own ignorance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ave you read all these?&rdquo; asked the Wonder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A greater part of them&mdash;in effect,&rdquo; replied
Challis. &ldquo;There is much repetition, you understand, and much
record of experiment which becomes, in a sense, worthless when the
conclusions are either finally accepted or rejected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The eyes of the Wonder shifted and their expression became
abstracted; he seemed to lose consciousness <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb153" href="#pb153" name="pb153">153</a>]</span>of
the outer world; he wore the look which you may see in the eyes of
Jakob Schlesinger&rsquo;s portrait of the mature Hegel, a look of
profound introspection and analysis.</p>
<p>There was an interval of silence, and then the Wonder unknowingly
gave expression to a quotation from Hamlet. &ldquo;Words,&rdquo; he
whispered reflectively, and then again &ldquo;words.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">II</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Challis understood him. &ldquo;You have not yet
learned the meaning of words?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>The brief period&mdash;the only one recorded&mdash;of amazement and
submission was over. It may be that he had doubted during those few
minutes of time whether he was well advised to enter into that world of
books, whether he would not by so doing stunt his own mental growth. It
may be that the decision of so momentous a question should have been
postponed for a year&mdash;two years; to a time when his mind should
have had further possibilities for unlettered expansion. However that
may be, he decided now and finally. He walked to the table and climbed
up on a chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Books about words,&rdquo; he commanded, and pointed at
Challis and Lewes.</p>
<p>They brought him the latest production of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb154" href="#pb154" name=
"pb154">154</a>]</span>twentieth century in many volumes, the work of a
dozen eminent authorities on the etymology of the English language, and
they seated him on eight volumes of the <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia
Britannica</i> (India paper edition) in order that he might reach the
level of the table.</p>
<p>At first they tried to show him how his wonderful dictionary should
be used, but he pushed them on one side, neither then nor at any future
time would he consent to be taught&mdash;the process was too tedious
for him, his mind worked more fluently, rapidly, and comprehensively
than the mind of the most gifted teacher that could have been found for
him.</p>
<p>So Challis and Lewes stood on one side and watched him, and he was
no more embarrassed by their presence than if they had been in another
world, as, possibly, they were.</p>
<p>He began with volume one, and he read the title page and the
introduction, the list of abbreviations, and all the preliminary matter
in due order.</p>
<p>Challis noted that when the Wonder began to read, he read no faster
than the average educated man, but that he acquired facility at a most
astounding rate, and that when he had been reading for a few days his
eye swept down the column, as it were at a single glance.</p>
<p>Challis and Lewes watched him for, perhaps, half an hour, and then,
seeing that their presence was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb155"
href="#pb155" name="pb155">155</a>]</span>of an entirely negligible
value to the Wonder, they left him and went into the farther room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; asked Challis, &ldquo;what do you make of
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he reading or pretending to read?&rdquo; parried Lewes.
&ldquo;Do you think it possible that he could read so fast? Moreover,
remember that he has admitted that he knows few words of the English
language, yet he does not refer from volume to volume; he does not look
up the meanings of the many unknown words which must occur in every
definition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know. I had noticed that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you think he <i>is</i> humbugging&mdash;pretending to
read?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; that solution seems to me altogether unlikely. He could
not, for one thing, simulate that look of attention. Remember, Lewes,
the child is not yet five years old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your explanation, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am wondering whether the child has not a memory beside
which the memory of a Macaulay would appear insignificant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lewes did not grasp Challis&rsquo;s intention. &ldquo;Even so
&hellip;&rdquo; he began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; continued Challis, &ldquo;I am wondering whether,
if that is the case, he is, in effect, prepared to learn the whole
dictionary by heart, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href="#pb156"
name="pb156">156</a>]</span>and, so to speak, collate its contents
later, in his mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Sir!&rdquo; Lewes smiled. The supposition was too
outrageous to be taken seriously. &ldquo;Surely, you can&rsquo;t mean
that.&rdquo; There was something in Lewes&rsquo;s tone which carried a
hint of contempt for so far-fetched a hypothesis.</p>
<p>Challis was pacing up and down the library, his hands clasped behind
him. &ldquo;Yes, I mean it,&rdquo; he said, without looking up.
&ldquo;I put it forward as a serious theory, worthy of full
consideration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lewes sneered. &ldquo;Oh, surely not, sir,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Challis stopped and faced him. &ldquo;Why not, Lewes; why
not?&rdquo; he asked, with a kindly smile. &ldquo;Think of the gap
which separates your intellectual powers from those of a Polynesian
savage. Why, after all, should it be impossible that this child&rsquo;s
powers should equally transcend our own? A freak, if you will, an
abnormality, a curious effect of nature&rsquo;s, like the giant
puff-ball&mdash;but still&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! yes, sir, I grant you the thing is not impossible from a
theoretical point of view,&rdquo; argued Lewes, &ldquo;but I think you
are theorising on altogether insufficient evidence. I am willing to
admit that such a freak is theoretically possible, but I have not yet
found the indications of such a power in the child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Challis resumed his pacing. &ldquo;Quite, quite,&rdquo; he
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href="#pb157" name=
"pb157">157</a>]</span>assented; &ldquo;your method is perfectly
correct&mdash;perfectly correct. We must wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At twelve o&rsquo;clock Challis brought a glass of milk and some
biscuits, and set them beside the Wonder&mdash;he was at the letter
&ldquo;B.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, how are you getting on?&rdquo; asked Challis.</p>
<p>The Wonder took not the least notice of the question, but he
stretched out a little hand and took a biscuit and ate it, without
looking up from his reading.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish he&rsquo;d answer questions,&rdquo; Challis remarked
to Lewes, later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should prescribe a sound shaking,&rdquo; returned
Lewes.</p>
<p>Challis smiled. &ldquo;Well, see here, Lewes,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take the responsibility; you go and experiment, go
and shake him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lewes looked through the folding doors at the picture of the Wonder,
intent on his study of the great dictionary. &ldquo;Since you&rsquo;ve
franked me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it&mdash;but not now.
I&rsquo;ll wait till he gives me some occasion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; replied Challis, &ldquo;my offer holds &hellip;
and, by the way, I have no doubt that an occasion will present itself.
Doesn&rsquo;t it strike you as likely, Lewes, that we shall see a good
deal of the child here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They stood for some minutes, watching the picture <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb158" href="#pb158" name="pb158">158</a>]</span>of
that intent student, framed in the written thoughts of his
predecessors.</p>

<p class="first">The Wonder ignored an invitation to lunch; he ignored,
also, the tray that was sent in to him. He read on steadily till a
quarter to six, by which time he was at the end of &ldquo;L,&rdquo; and
then he climbed down from his Encyclop&aelig;dia, and made for the
door. Challis, working in the farther room, saw him and came out to
open the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going now?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>The child nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will order the cart for you, if you will wait ten
minutes,&rdquo; said Challis.</p>
<p>The child shook his head. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very necessary to have
air,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Something in the tone and pronunciation struck Challis, and awoke a
long dormant memory. The sentence spoken, suddenly conjured up a vision
of the Stotts&rsquo; cottage at Stoke, of the Stotts at tea, of a
cradle in the shadow, and of himself, sitting in an uncomfortable
armchair and swinging his stick between his knees. When the child had
gone&mdash;walking deliberately, and evidently regarding the
mile-and-a-half walk through the twilight wood and over the deserted
Common as a trivial incident in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb159"
href="#pb159" name="pb159">159</a>]</span>the day&rsquo;s
business&mdash;Challis set himself to analyse that curious
association.</p>
<p>As he strolled back across the hall to the library, he tried to
reconstruct the scene of the cottage at Stoke, and to recall the
outline of the conversation he had had with the Stotts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lewes!&rdquo; he said, when he reached the room in which his
secretary was working, &ldquo;Lewes, this is curious,&rdquo; and he
described the associations called up by the child&rsquo;s speech.
&ldquo;The curious thing is,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;that I had
gone to advise Mrs. Stott to take a cottage at Pym, because the Stoke
villagers were hostile, in some way, and she did not care to take the
child out in the street. It is more than probable that I used just
those words, &lsquo;It is very necessary to have air,&rsquo; very
probable. Now, what about my memory theory? The child was only six
months old at that time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lewes appeared unconvinced. &ldquo;There is nothing very unusual in
the sentence,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; replied Challis, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
agree with you. It is not phrased as a villager would phrase it, and,
as I tell you, it was not spoken with the local accent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may have spoken the sentence to-day,&rdquo; suggested
Lewes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may, of course, though I don&rsquo;t remember saying
anything of the sort, but that would not account for <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb160" href="#pb160" name="pb160">160</a>]</span>the
curiously vivid association which was conjured up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lewes pursed his lips. &ldquo;No, no, no,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But
that is hardly ground for argument, is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose not,&rdquo; returned Challis thoughtfully;
&ldquo;but when you take up psychology, Lewes, I should much like you
to specialise in a careful inquiry into association in connection with
memory. I feel certain that if one can reproduce, as nearly as may be,
any complex sensation one has experienced, no matter how long ago, one
will stimulate what I may call an abnormal memory of all the
associations connected with that experience. Just now I saw the
interior of that room in the Stotts&rsquo; cottage so clearly that I
had an image of a dreadful oleograph of Disraeli hanging on the wall.
But, now, I cannot for the life of me remember whether there was such
an oleograph or not. I do not remember noticing it at the
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s very interesting,&rdquo; replied Lewes.
&ldquo;There is certainly a wide field for research in that
direction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might throw much light on our mental processes,&rdquo;
replied Challis.</p>
<p>(It was as the outcome of this conversation that Gregory Lewes did,
two years afterwards, take up this line of study. The only result up to
the present time is his little brochure <i>Reflexive Associations</i>,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb161" href="#pb161" name=

subject.)</p>

<p class="first">Challis&rsquo;s anticipation that he and Lewes would
be greatly favoured by the Wonder&rsquo;s company was fully
realised.</p>
<p>The child put in an appearance at half-past nine the next morning,
just as the governess cart was starting out to fetch him. When he was
admitted he went straight to the library, climbed on to the chair, upon
which the volumes of the Encyclop&aelig;dia still remained, and
continued his reading where he had left off on the previous
evening.</p>
<p>He read steadily throughout the day without giving utterance to
speech of any kind.</p>
<p>Challis and Lewes went out in the afternoon, and left the child deep
in study. They came in at five o&rsquo;clock, and went to the library.
The Wonder, however, was not there.</p>
<p>Challis rang the bell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has little Stott gone?&rdquo; he asked when Heathcote
came.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I &rsquo;aven&rsquo;t seen &rsquo;im, sir,&rdquo; said
Heathcote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just find out if any one opened the door for him, will
you?&rdquo; said Challis. &ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t possibly have opened
that door for himself.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb162"
href="#pb162" name="pb162">162</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;No one &rsquo;asn&rsquo;t let Master Stott hout, sir,&rdquo;
Heathcote reported on his return.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite sure, sir. I&rsquo;ve made full hinquiries,&rdquo; said
Heathcote with dignity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;d better find him,&rdquo; said Challis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The window is open,&rdquo; suggested Lewes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He would hardly &hellip;&rdquo; began Challis, walking over
to the low sill of the open window, but he broke off in his sentence
and continued, &ldquo;By Jove, he did, though; look here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was, indeed, quite obvious that the Wonder had made his exit by
the window; the tiny prints of his feet were clearly marked in the
mould of the flowerbed; he had, moreover, disregarded all results of
early spring floriculture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See how he has smashed those daffodils,&rdquo; said Lewes.
&ldquo;What an infernally cheeky little brute he is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What interests me is the logic of the child,&rdquo; returned
Challis. &ldquo;I would venture to guess that he wasted no time in
trying to attract attention. The door was closed, so he just got out of
the window. I rather admire the spirit; there is something Napoleonic
about him. Don&rsquo;t you think so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lewes shrugged his shoulders. Heathcote&rsquo;s expression was quite
non-committal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better send Jessop up to Pym, Heathcote,&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href="#pb163" name=
"pb163">163</a>]</span>said Challis. &ldquo;Let him find out whether
the child is safe at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jessop reported an hour afterwards that Master Stott had arrived
home quite safely, and Mrs. Stott was much obliged.</p>

<p class="first">&ldquo;What can I give that child to read
to-day?&rdquo; asked Challis at breakfast next morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should reverse the arrangement; let him sit on the
Dictionary and read the Encyclop&aelig;dia.&rdquo; Lewes always
approached the subject of the Wonder with a certain supercilious
contempt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not convinced yet that he isn&rsquo;t
humbugging?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! Frankly, I&rsquo;m not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, we must wait for more evidence, before we argue
about it,&rdquo; said Challis, but they sat on over the
breakfast-table, waiting for the child to put in an appearance, and
their conversation hovered over the topic of his intelligence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Half-past ten?&rdquo; Challis ejaculated at last, with
surprise. &ldquo;We are getting into slack habits, Lewes.&rdquo; He
rose and rang the bell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Apparently the Stott infant has had enough of it,&rdquo;
suggested Lewes. &ldquo;Perhaps he has exhausted the interest of
dictionary illustrations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall see,&rdquo; replied Challis, and then to a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href="#pb164" name=
"pb164">164</a>]</span>deferentially appearing Heathcote he said:
&ldquo;Has Master Stott come this morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir. Leastways, no one &rsquo;asn&rsquo;t let &rsquo;im
in, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be that he is mentally collating the results of the
past two days&rsquo; reading,&rdquo; said Challis, as he and Lewes made
their way to the library.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; was all Lewes&rsquo;s reply, but it conveyed much
of impatient contempt for his employer&rsquo;s attitude.</p>
<p>Challis only smiled.</p>
<p>When they entered the library they found the Wonder hard at work,
and he had, of his own initiative, adopted the plan ironically
suggested by Lewes, for he had succeeded in transferring the Dictionary
volumes to the chair, and he was deep in volume one, of the eleventh
edition of the <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica</i>.</p>
<p>The library was never cleared up by any one except Challis or his
deputy, but an early housemaid had been sent to dust, and she had left
the casement of one of the lower lights of the window open. The means
of the Wonder&rsquo;s entrance was thus clearly in evidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Napoleonic,&rdquo; murmured Challis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s most infernal cheek,&rdquo; returned Lewes in a
loud voice, &ldquo;I should not be at all surprised if that promised
shaking were not administered to-day.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb165" href="#pb165" name="pb165">165</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Wonder took no notice. Challis says that on that morning his
eyes were travelling down the page at about the rate at which one could
count the lines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t reading,&rdquo; said Lewes. &ldquo;No one
could read as fast as that, and most certainly not a child of four and
a half.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he would only answer questions&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;
hesitated Challis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! of course he won&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; said Lewes.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s clever enough not to give himself away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two men went over to the table and looked down over the
child&rsquo;s shoulder. He was in the middle of the article on
algebra.</p>
<p>Lewes made a gesture. &ldquo;Now do you believe he&rsquo;s
humbugging?&rdquo; he asked confidently, and made no effort to modulate
his voice.</p>
<p>Challis drew his eyebrows together. &ldquo;My boy,&rdquo; he said,
and laid his hand lightly on Victor Stott&rsquo;s shoulder, &ldquo;can
you understand what you are reading there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But no answer was vouchsafed. Challis sighed. &ldquo;Come along,
Lewes,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;we must waste no more time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lewes wore a look of smug triumph as they went to the farther room,
but he was clever enough to refrain from expressing his triumph in
speech. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href="#pb166" name=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Challis gave directions that the window which the
Wonder had found to be his most convenient method of entry and exit
should be kept open, except at night; and a stool was placed under the
sill inside the room, and a low bench was fixed outside to facilitate
the child&rsquo;s goings and comings. Also, a little path was made
across the flowerbed.</p>
<p>The Wonder gave no trouble. He arrived at nine o&rsquo;clock every
morning, Sunday included, and left at a quarter to six in the evening.
On wet days he was provided with a waterproof which had evidently been
made by his mother out of a larger garment. This he took off when he
entered the room and left on the stool under the window.</p>
<p>He was given a glass of milk and a plate of bread-and-butter at
twelve o&rsquo;clock; and except for this he demanded and received no
attention.</p>
<p>For three weeks he devoted himself exclusively to the study of the
Encyclop&aelig;dia.</p>
<p>Lewes was puzzled.</p>
<p>Challis spoke little of the child during these three weeks, but he
often stood at the entrance to the farther rooms and watched the
Wonder&rsquo;s eyes travelling so rapidly yet so intently down the
page. That sight had a curious fascination for him; he returned
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167" name=
"pb167">167</a>]</span>to his own work by an effort, and an hour
afterwards he would be back again at the door of the larger room.
Sometimes Lewes would hear him mutter: &ldquo;If he would only answer a
few questions&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo; There was always one hope in
Challis&rsquo;s mind. He hoped that some sort of climax might be
reached when the Encyclop&aelig;dia was finished. The child must, at
least, ask then for another book. Even if he chose one for himself, his
choice might furnish some sort of a test.</p>
<p>So Challis waited and said little; and Lewes was puzzled, because he
was beginning to doubt whether it were possible that the child could
sustain a pose so long. That, in itself, would be evidence of
extraordinary abnormality. Lewes fumbled in his mind for another
hypothesis.</p>
<p>This reading craze may be symptomatic of some form of idiocy, was
his thought; &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t believe he does read,&rdquo; was
the inevitable rider.</p>
<p>Mrs. Stott usually came to meet her son, and sometimes she would
come early in the afternoon and stand at the window watching him at his
work; but neither Challis nor Lewes ever saw the Wonder display by any
sign that he was aware of his mother&rsquo;s presence.</p>
<p>During those three weeks the Wonder held himself completely detached
from any intercourse with the world of men. At the end of that period
he once <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="#pb168" name=
"pb168">168</a>]</span>more manifested his awareness of the human
factor in existence.</p>
<p>Challis, if he spoke little to Lewes of the Wonder during this time,
maintained a strict observation of the child&rsquo;s doings.</p>
<p>The Wonder began his last volume of the Encyclop&aelig;dia one
Wednesday afternoon soon after lunch, and on Thursday morning, Challis
was continually in and out of the room watching the child&rsquo;s
progress, and noting his nearness to the end of the colossal task he
had undertaken.</p>
<p>At a quarter to twelve he took up his old position in the doorway,
and with his hands clasped behind his back he watched the reading of
the last forty pages.</p>
<p>There was no slackening and no quickening in the Wonder&rsquo;s rate
of progress. He read the articles under &ldquo;Z&rdquo; with the same
attention he had given to the remainder of the work, and then, arrived
at the last page, he closed the volume and took up the Index.</p>
<p>Challis suffered a qualm; not so much on account of the possible
postponement of the crisis he was awaiting, as because he saw that the
reading of the Index could only be taken as a sign that the whole study
had been unintelligent. No one could conceivably have any purpose in
reading through an index. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb169" href=
"#pb169" name="pb169">169</a>]</span></p>
<p>And at this moment Lewes joined him in the doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What volume has he got to now?&rdquo; asked Lewes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Index,&rdquo; returned Challis.</p>
<p>Lewes was no less quick in drawing his inference than Challis had
been.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that settles it, I should think,&rdquo; was
Lewes&rsquo;s comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait, wait,&rdquo; returned Challis.</p>
<p>The Wonder turned a dozen pages at once, glanced at the new opening,
made a further brief examination of two or three headings near the end
of the volume, closed the book, and looked up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you finished?&rdquo; asked Challis.</p>
<p>The Wonder shook his head. &ldquo;All this,&rdquo; he said&mdash;he
indicated with a small and dirty hand the pile of volumes that were
massed round him&mdash;&ldquo;all this &hellip;&rdquo; he repeated,
hesitated for a word, and again shook his head with that solemn,
deliberate impressiveness which marked all his actions.</p>
<p>Challis came towards the child, leaned over the table for a moment,
and then sat down opposite to him. Between the two protagonists hovered
Lewes, sceptical, inclined towards aggression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am most interested,&rdquo; said Challis. &ldquo;Will you
try to tell me, my boy, what you think of&mdash;all this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So elementary &hellip; inchoate &hellip; a <span class="corr"
id="xd26e2938" title="Source: disjuncttive">disjunctive</span>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href="#pb170" name=
"pb170">170</a>]</span>&hellip; patchwork&rdquo; replied the Wonder.
His abstracted eyes were blind to the objective world of our reality;
he seemed to be profoundly analysing the very elements of thought.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Then that almost voiceless child found words.
Heathcote&rsquo;s announcement of lunch was waved aside, the long
afternoon waned, and still that thin trickle of sound flowed on.</p>
<p>The Wonder spoke in odd, pedantic phrases; he used the
technicalities of every science; he constructed his sentences in
unusual ways, and often he paused for a word and gave up the search,
admitting that his meaning could not be expressed through the medium of
any language known to him.</p>
<p>Occasionally Challis would interrupt him fiercely, would even rise
from his chair and pace the room, arguing, stating a point of view,
combating some suggestion that underlay the trend of that pitiless
wisdom which in the end bore him down with its unanswerable
insistence.</p>
<p>During those long hours much was stated by that small, thin voice
which was utterly beyond the comprehension of the two listeners;
indeed, it is doubtful whether even Challis understood a tithe of the
theory that was actually expressed in words. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href="#pb171" name="pb171">171</a>]</span></p>
<p>As for Lewes, though he was at the time non-plussed, quelled, he was
in the outcome impressed rather by the marvellous powers of memory
exhibited than by the far finer powers shown in the superhuman logic of
the synthesis.</p>
<p>One sees that Lewes entered upon the interview with a mind
predisposed to criticise, to destroy. There can be no doubt that as he
listened his uninformed mind was endeavouring to analyse, to weigh, and
to oppose; and this antagonism and his own thoughts continually
interposed between him and the thought of the speaker. Lewes&rsquo;s
account of what was spoken on that afternoon is utterly worthless.</p>
<p>Challis&rsquo;s failure to comprehend was not, at the outset, due to
his antagonistic attitude. He began with an earnest wish to understand:
he failed only because the thing spoken was beyond the scope of his
intellectual powers. But he did, nevertheless, understand the trend of
that analysis of progress; he did in some half-realised way apprehend
the gist of that terrible deduction of a final adjustment.</p>
<p>He must have apprehended, in part, for he fiercely combated the
argument, only to quaver, at last, into a silence which permitted again
that trickle of hesitating, pedantic speech, which was yet so
overwhelming, so conclusive.</p>
<p>As the afternoon wore on, however, Challis&rsquo;s <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href="#pb172" name=
"pb172">172</a>]</span>attitude must have changed; he must have assumed
an armour of mental resistance not unlike the resistance of Lewes.
Challis perceived, however dimly, that life would hold no further
pleasure for him if he accepted that theory of origin, evolution, and
final adjustment; he found in this cosmogony no place for his own
idealism; and he feared to be convinced even by that fraction of the
whole argument which he could understand.</p>
<p>We see that Challis, with all his apparent devotion to science, was
never more than a dilettante. He had another stake in the world which,
at the last analysis, he valued more highly than the acquisition of
knowledge. Those means of ease, of comfort, of liberty, of opportunity
to choose his work among various interests, were the ruling influence
of his life. With it all Challis was an idealist, and unpractical. His
genial charity, his refinement of mind, his unthinking generosity,
indicate the bias of a character which inclined always towards a
picturesque optimism. It is not difficult to understand that he dared
not allow himself to be convinced by Victor Stott&rsquo;s appalling
synthesis.</p>
<p>At last, when the twilight was deepening into night, the voice
ceased, the child&rsquo;s story had been told, and it had not been
understood. The Wonder never again spoke of his theory of life. He
realised from that time that no one could comprehend him. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href="#pb173" name="pb173">173</a>]</span></p>
<p>As he rose to go, he asked one question that, simple as was its
expression, had a deep and wonderful significance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there none of my kind?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Is
this,&rdquo; and he laid a hand on the pile of books before him,
&ldquo;is this all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is none of your kind,&rdquo; replied Challis; and the
little figure born into a world that could not understand him, that was
not ready to receive him, walked to the window and climbed out into the
darkness.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>(Henry Challis is the only man who could ever have given any account
of that extraordinary analysis of life, and he made no effort to recall
the fundamental basis of the argument, and so allowed his memory of the
essential part to fade. Moreover, he had a marked disinclination to
speak of that afternoon or of anything that was said by Victor Stott
during those six momentous hours of expression. It is evident that
Challis&rsquo;s attitude to Victor Stott was not unlike the attitude of
Captain Wallis to Victor Stott&rsquo;s father on the occasion of
Hampdenshire&rsquo;s historic match with Surrey. &ldquo;This man will
have to be barred,&rdquo; Wallis said. &ldquo;It means the end of
cricket.&rdquo; Challis, in effect, thought that if Victor Stott were
encouraged, it would mean the end of research, philosophy, all the
mystery, idealism, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href="#pb174"
name="pb174">174</a>]</span>and joy of life. Once, and once only, did
Challis give me any idea of what he had learned during that
afternoon&rsquo;s colloquy, and the substance of what Challis then told
me will be found at the end of this volume.) <span class=

<p class="first">For many months after that long afternoon in the
library, Challis was affected with a fever of restlessness, and his
work on the book stood still. He was in Rome during May, and in June he
was seized by a sudden whim and went to China by the Trans-Siberian
railway. Lewes did not accompany him. Challis preferred, one imagines,
to have no intercourse with Lewes while the memory of certain
pronouncements was still fresh. He might have been tempted to discuss
that interview, and if, as was practically certain, Lewes attempted to
pour contempt on the whole affair, Challis might have been drawn into a
defence which would have revived many memories he wished to
obliterate.</p>
<p>He came back to London in September&mdash;he made the return journey
by steamer&mdash;and found his secretary still working at the monograph
on the primitive peoples of Melanesia. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb176" href="#pb176" name="pb176">176</a>]</span></p>
<p>Lewes had spent the whole summer in Challis&rsquo;s town house in
Eaton Square, whither all the material had been removed two days after
that momentous afternoon in the library of Challis Court.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been wanting your help badly for some time,
sir,&rdquo; Lewes said on the evening of Challis&rsquo;s return.
&ldquo;Are you proposing to take up the work again? If
not&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo; Gregory Lewes thought he was wasting
valuable time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, of course; I am ready to begin again now, if you
care to go on with me,&rdquo; said Challis. He talked for a few minutes
of the book without any great show of interest. Presently they came to
a pause, and Lewes suggested that he should give some account of how
his time had been spent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; replied Challis, &ldquo;to-morrow will be
time enough. I shall settle down again in a few days.&rdquo; He
hesitated a moment, and then said: &ldquo;Any news from
Chilborough?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;N-no, I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; returned Lewes. He was
occupied with his own interests; he doubted Challis&rsquo;s intention
to continue his work on the book&mdash;the announcement had been so
half-hearted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about that child?&rdquo; asked Challis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That child?&rdquo; Lewes appeared to have forgotten the
existence of Victor Stott.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That abnormal child of Stott&rsquo;s?&rdquo; prompted
Challis. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb177" href="#pb177" name=
"pb177">177</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Of course, yes. I believe he still goes nearly every day
to the library. I have been down there two or three times, and found
him reading. He has learned the use of the index-catalogue. He can get
any book he wants. He uses the steps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know what he reads?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I can&rsquo;t say I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think will become of him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! these infant prodigies, you know,&rdquo; said Lewes with
a large air of authority, &ldquo;they all go the same way. Most of them
die young, of course, the others develop into ordinary commonplace men
rather under than over the normal ability. After all, it is what one
would expect. Nature always maintains her average by some means or
another. If a child like this with his abnormal memory were to go on
developing, there would be no place for him in the world&rsquo;s
economy. The idea is inconceivable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite, quite,&rdquo; murmured Challis, and after a short
silence he added: &ldquo;You think he will deteriorate, that his
faculties will decay prematurely?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say there could be no doubt of it,&rdquo; replied
Lewes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! well. I&rsquo;ll go down and have a look at him, one day
next week,&rdquo; said Challis; but he did not go till the middle of
October.</p>
<p>The direct cause of his going was a letter from <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb178" href="#pb178" name=
"pb178">178</a>]</span>Crashaw, who offered to come up to town, as the
matter was one of &ldquo;really peculiar urgency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if young Stott has been blaspheming again,&rdquo;
Challis remarked to Lewes. &ldquo;Wire the man that I&rsquo;ll go down
and see him this afternoon. I shall motor. Say I&rsquo;ll be at Stoke
about half-past three.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Challis was ushered into Crashaw&rsquo;s study on his
arrival, and found the rector in company with another
man&mdash;introduced as Mr. Forman&mdash;a jolly-looking,
high-complexioned man of sixty or so, with a great quantity of white
hair on his head and face; he was wearing an old-fashioned morning-coat
and grey trousers that were noticeably too short for him.</p>
<p>Crashaw lost no time in introducing the subject of &ldquo;really
peculiar urgency,&rdquo; but he rambled in his introduction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have probably forgotten,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that last
spring I had to bring a most horrible charge against a child called
Victor Stott, who has since been living, practically, as I may say,
under your &aelig;gis, that is, he has, at least, spent a greater part
of his day, er&mdash;playing in your library at Challis
Court.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite, quite; I remember perfectly,&rdquo; said Challis.
&ldquo;I made myself responsible for him up to a certain <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb179" href="#pb179" name=
"pb179">179</a>]</span>point. I gave him an occupation. It was
intended, was it not, to divert his mind from speaking against religion
to the yokels?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite a character, if I may say so,&rdquo; put in Mr. Forman
cheerfully.</p>
<p>Crashaw was seated at his study table; the affair had something the
effect of an examining magistrate taking the evidence of witnesses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; he said testily; &ldquo;I did ask your help,
Mr. Challis, and I did, in a way, receive some assistance from you.
That is, the child has to some extent been isolated by spending so much
of his time at your house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has he broken out again?&rdquo; asked Challis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I understand you to mean has the child been speaking
openly on any subject connected with religion, I must say
&lsquo;No,&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo; said Crashaw. &ldquo;But he never
attends any Sunday school, or place of worship; he has received no
instruction in&mdash;er&mdash;any sacred subject, though I understand
he is able to read; and his time is spent among books which, pardon me,
would not, I suppose, be likely to give a serious turn to his
thoughts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Serious?&rdquo; questioned Challis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I should say &lsquo;religious,&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;
replied Crashaw. &ldquo;To me the two words are synonymous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Forman bowed his head slightly with an air of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb180" href="#pb180" name=
"pb180">180</a>]</span>reverence, and nodded two or three times to
express his perfect approval of the rector&rsquo;s sentiments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think the child&rsquo;s mind is being perverted by his
intercourse with the books in the library where
he&mdash;he&mdash;&lsquo;plays&rsquo; was your word, I
believe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not altogether,&rdquo; replied Crashaw, drawing his
eyebrows together. &ldquo;We can hardly suppose that he is able at so
tender an age to read, much less to understand, those works of
philosophy and science which would produce an evil effect on his mind.
I am willing to admit, since I, too, have had some training in
scientific reading, that writers on those subjects are not easily
understood even by the mature intelligence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why, exactly, do you wish me to prohibit the child from
coming to Challis Court?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly you have not realised that the child is now five
years old?&rdquo; said Crashaw with an air of conferring
illumination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed! Yes. An age of some discretion, no doubt,&rdquo;
returned Challis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An age at which the State requires that he should receive the
elements of education,&rdquo; continued Crashaw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; said Challis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time he went to school,&rdquo; explained Mr. Forman.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been after him, you know. I&rsquo;m the attendance
officer for this district.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb181"
href="#pb181" name="pb181">181</a>]</span></p>
<p>Challis for once committed a breach of good manners. The import of
the thing suddenly appealed to his sense of humour: he began to chuckle
and then he laughed out a great, hearty laugh, such as had not been
stirred in him for twenty years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! forgive me, forgive me,&rdquo; he said, when he had
recovered his self-control. &ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t know; you
can&rsquo;t conceive the utter, childish absurdity of setting that
child to recite the multiplication table with village infants of his
own age. Oh! believe me, if you could only guess, you would laugh with
me. It&rsquo;s so funny, so inimitably funny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fail to see, Mr. Challis,&rdquo; said Crashaw, &ldquo;that
there is anything in any way absurd or&mdash;or unusual in the
preposition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five is the age fixed by the State,&rdquo; said Mr. Forman.
He had relaxed into a broad smile in sympathy with Challis&rsquo;s
laugh, but he had now relapsed into a fair imitation of Crashaw&rsquo;s
intense seriousness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! How can I explain?&rdquo; said Challis. &ldquo;Let me
take an instance. You propose to teach him, among other things, the
elements of arithmetic?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a part of the curriculum,&rdquo; replied Mr.
Forman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have only had one conversation with this child,&rdquo; went
on Challis&mdash;and at the mention of that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb182" href="#pb182" name=
"pb182">182</a>]</span>conversation his brows drew together and he
became very grave again; &ldquo;but in the course of that conversation
this child had occasion to refer, by way of illustration, to some
abstruse theorem of the differential calculus. He did it, you will
understand, by way of making his meaning clear&mdash;though the
illustration was utterly beyond me: that reference represented an act
of intellectual condescension.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless me, you don&rsquo;t say so?&rdquo; said Mr.
Forman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot see,&rdquo; said Crashaw, &ldquo;that this instance
of yours, Mr. Challis, has any real bearing on the situation. If the
child is a mathematical genius&mdash;there have been instances in
history, such as Blaise Pascal&mdash;he would not, of course, receive
elementary instruction in a subject with which he was already
acquainted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could not find any subject, believe me, Crashaw, in which
he could be instructed by any teacher in a Council school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive me, I don&rsquo;t agree with you,&rdquo; returned
Crashaw. &ldquo;He is sadly in need of some religious
training.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He would not get that at a Council school,&rdquo; said
Challis, and Mr. Forman shook his head sadly, as though he greatly
deprecated the fact.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must learn to recognise authority,&rdquo; said Crashaw.
&ldquo;When he has been taught the necessity <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb183" href="#pb183" name="pb183">183</a>]</span>of
submitting himself to all his governors, teachers, spiritual pastors,
and masters: ordering himself lowly and reverently to all his betters;
when, I say, he has learnt that lesson, he may be in a fit and proper
condition to receive the teachings of the Holy Church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Forman appeared to think he was attending divine service. If the
rector had said &ldquo;Let us pray,&rdquo; there can be no doubt that
he would immediately have fallen on his knees.</p>
<p>Challis shook his head. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t understand,
Crashaw,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>do</i> understand,&rdquo; said Crashaw, rising to his
feet, &ldquo;and I intend to see that the statute is not disobeyed in
the case of this child, Victor Stott.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Challis shrugged his shoulders; Mr. Forman assumed an expression of
stern determination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In any case, why drag me into it?&rdquo; asked Challis.</p>
<p>Crashaw sat down again. The flush which had warmed his sallow skin
subsided as his passion died out. He had worked himself into a
condition of righteous indignation, but the calm politeness of Challis
rebuked him. If Crashaw prided himself on his devotion to the Church,
he did not wish that attitude to overshadow the pride he also took in
the belief that he was Challis&rsquo;s social equal. Crashaw&rsquo;s
father had been a lawyer, with a fair practice in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href="#pb184" name=
"pb184">184</a>]</span>Derby, but he had worked his way up to a
partnership from the position of office-boy, and Percy Crashaw seldom
forgot to be conscious that he was a gentleman by education and
profession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not wish to <i>drag</i> you into this business,&rdquo;
he said quietly, putting his elbows on the writing-table in front of
him, and reassuming the judicial attitude he had adopted earlier;
&ldquo;but I regard this child as, in some sense, your
prot&eacute;g&eacute;.&rdquo; Crashaw put the tips of his fingers
together, and Mr. Forman watched him warily, waiting for his cue. If
this was to be a case for prayer, Mr. Forman was ready, with a clean
white handkerchief to kneel upon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In some sense, perhaps,&rdquo; returned Challis. &ldquo;I
haven&rsquo;t seen him for some months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cannot you see the necessity of his attending school?&rdquo;
asked Crashaw, this time with an insinuating suavity; he believed that
Challis was coming round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Challis sighed with a note of expostulation.
&ldquo;Oh! the thing&rsquo;s grotesque, ridiculous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; put in Mr. Forman, who had been
struck by a brilliant idea, &ldquo;why not bring the child here, and
let the Reverend Mr. Crashaw, or myself, put a few general questions to
&rsquo;im?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye-es,&rdquo; hesitated Crashaw, &ldquo;that might be done;
but, of course, the decision does not rest with us.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb185" href="#pb185" name="pb185">185</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;It rests with the Local Authority,&rdquo; mused Challis. He
was running over three or four names of members of that body who were
known to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Crashaw, &ldquo;the Local Education
Authority alone has the right to prosecute, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He
did not state his antithesis. They had come to the crux which Crashaw
had wished to avoid. He had no weight with the committee of the L.E.A.,
and Challis&rsquo;s recommendation would have much weight. Crashaw
intended that Victor Stott should attend school, but he had bungled his
preliminaries: he had rested on his own authority, and forgotten that
Challis had little respect for that influence. Conciliation was the
only card to play now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I brought him, he wouldn&rsquo;t answer your
questions,&rdquo; sighed Challis. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s very difficult to
deal with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he, indeed?&rdquo; sympathised Mr. Forman.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve &rsquo;ardly seen &rsquo;im myself; not to speak to,
that is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He might come with his mother,&rdquo; suggested Crashaw.</p>
<p>Challis shook his head. &ldquo;By the way, it is the mother whom you
would proceed against?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The parent is responsible,&rdquo; said Mr. Forman. &ldquo;She
will be brought before a magistrate and fined for the first
offence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t fine her if she comes before me,&rdquo;
replied Challis. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb186" href="#pb186"
name="pb186">186</a>]</span></p>
<p>Crashaw smiled. He meant to avoid that eventuality.</p>
<p>The little meeting lapsed into a brief silence. There seemed to be
nothing more to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Crashaw, at last, with a rising inflexion
that had a conciliatory, encouraging, now-my-little-man kind of air,
&ldquo;We-ll, of course, no one wishes to proceed to extremes. I think,
Mr. Challis, I think I may say that you are the person who has most
influence in this matter, and I cannot believe that you will go against
the established authority both of the Church and the State. If it were
only for the sake of example.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Challis rose deliberately. He shook his head, and unconsciously his
hands went behind his back. There was hardly room for him to pace up
and down, but he took two steps towards Mr. Forman, who immediately
rose to his feet; and then he turned and went over to the window. It
was from there that he pronounced his ultimatum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Regulations, laws, religious and lay authorities,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;come into existence in order to deal with the rule, the
average. That must be so. But if we are a reasoning, intellectual
people we must have some means of dealing with the exception. That
means rests with a consensus of intelligent opinion strong enough to
set the rule upon one side. In an overwhelming majority of cases there
<i>is</i> no such consensus <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb187" href=
"#pb187" name="pb187">187</a>]</span>of opinion, and the exceptional
individual suffers by coming within the rule of a law which should not
apply to him. Now, I put it to you, as reasoning, intelligent
men&rdquo; (&rsquo;ear, &rsquo;ear, murmured Mr. Forman automatically),
&ldquo;are we, now that we have the power to perform a common act of
justice, to exempt an unfortunate individual exception who has come
within the rule of a law that holds no application for him, or are we
to exhibit a crass stupidity by enforcing that law? Is it not better to
take the case into our own hands, and act according to the dictates of
common sense?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very forcibly put,&rdquo; murmured Mr. Forman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not finding any fault with the law or the principle
of the law,&rdquo; continued Challis; &ldquo;but it is, it must be,
framed for the average. We must use our discretion in dealing with the
exception&mdash;and this is an exception such as has never occurred
since we have had an Education Act.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t agree with you,&rdquo; said Crashaw,
stubbornly. &ldquo;I do not consider this an exception.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you <i>must</i> agree with me, Crashaw. I have a certain
amount of influence and I shall use it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; replied Crashaw, rising to his feet,
&ldquo;I shall fight you to the bitter end. I am
<i>determined</i>&rdquo;&mdash;he raised his voice and struck the
writing-table with his fist&mdash;&ldquo;I am <i>determined</i> that
this infidel child shall go to school. I am prepared, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb188" href="#pb188" name="pb188">188</a>]</span>if
necessary, to spend all my leisure in seeing that the law is carried
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Forman had also risen. &ldquo;Very right, very right,
indeed,&rdquo; he said, and he knitted his mild brows and stroked his
patriarchal white beard with a simulation of stern determination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you would be better advised to let the matter
rest,&rdquo; said Challis.</p>
<p>Mr. Forman looked inquiringly at the representative of the
Church.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall fight,&rdquo; replied Crashaw, stubbornly,
fiercely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; said Mr. Forman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, as you think best,&rdquo; was Challis&rsquo;s last
word.</p>
<p>As Challis walked down to the gate, where his motor was awaiting
him, Mr. Forman trotted up from behind and ranged himself
alongside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More rain wanted yet for the roots, sir,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;September was a grand month for &rsquo;arvest, but we want rain
badly now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite, quite,&rdquo; murmured Challis, politely. He shook
hands with Mr. Forman before he got into the car.</p>
<p>Mr. Forman, standing politely bareheaded, saw that Mr.
Challis&rsquo;s car went in the direction of Ailesworth. <span class=

<p class="first">Challis&rsquo;s first visit was paid to Sir Deane
Elmer, that man of many activities, whose name inevitably suggests his
favourite phrase of &ldquo;Organised Progress&rdquo;&mdash;with all its
variants.</p>
<p>This is hardly the place in which to criticise a man of such diverse
abilities as Deane Elmer, a man whose name still figures so prominently
in the public press in connection with all that is most modern in
eugenics; with the Social Reform programme of the moderate party; with
the reconstruction of our penal system; with education, and so many
kindred interests; and, finally, of course, with colour photography and
process printing. This last Deane Elmer always spoke of as his hobby,
but we may doubt whether all his interests were not hobbies in the same
sense. He is the natural descendant of those earlier amateur
scientists&mdash;the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb190" href="#pb190"
name="pb190">190</a>]</span>adjective conveys no reproach&mdash;of the
nineteenth century, among whom we remember such striking figures as
those of Lord Avebury and Sir Francis Galton.</p>
<p>In appearance Deane Elmer was a big, heavy, rather corpulent man,
with a high complexion, and his clean-shaven jowl and his succession of
chins hung in heavy folds. But any suggestion of material grossness was
contradicted by the brightness of his rather pale-blue eyes, by his
alertness of manner, and by his ready, whimsical humour.</p>
<p>As chairman of the Ailesworth County Council, and its most prominent
unpaid public official&mdash;after the mayor&mdash;Sir Deane Elmer was
certainly the most important member of the Local Authority, and Challis
wisely sought him at once. He found him in the garden of his
comparatively small establishment on the Quainton side of the town.
Elmer was very much engaged in photographing flowers from nature
through the ruled screen and colour filter&mdash;in experimenting with
the Elmer process, in fact; by which the intermediate stage of a
coloured negative is rendered unnecessary. His apparatus was
complicated and cumbrous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Show Mr. Challis out here,&rdquo; he commanded the man who
brought the announcement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must forgive me, Challis,&rdquo; said Elmer, when Challis
appeared. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t had such a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb191" href="#pb191" name=
"pb191">191</a>]</span>still day for weeks. It&rsquo;s the wind upsets
us in this process. Screens create a partial vacuum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was launched on a lecture upon his darling process before Challis
could get in a word. It was best to let him have his head, and Challis
took an intelligent interest.</p>
<p>It was not until the photographs were taken, and his two assistants
could safely be trusted to complete the mechanical operations, that
Elmer could be divorced from his hobby. He was full of jubilation.
&ldquo;We should have excellent results,&rdquo; he boomed&mdash;he had
a tremendous voice&mdash;&ldquo;but we shan&rsquo;t be able to judge
until we get the blocks made. We do it all on the spot. I have a couple
of platens in the shops here; but we shan&rsquo;t be able to take a
pull until to-morrow morning, I&rsquo;m afraid. You shall have a proof,
Challis. We <i>should</i> get magnificent results.&rdquo; He looked
benignantly at the vault of heaven, which had been so obligingly free
from any current of air.</p>
<p>Challis was beginning to fear that even now he would be allowed no
opportunity to open the subject of his mission. But quite suddenly
Elmer dropped the shutter on his preoccupation, and with that ready
adaptability which was so characteristic of the man, forgot his hobby
for the time being, and turned his whole attention to a new
subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what is the latest news in
anthropology?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb192" href="#pb192"
name="pb192">192</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;A very remarkable phenomenon,&rdquo; replied Challis.
&ldquo;That is what I have come to see you about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you were in Paraguay pigging it with the
Guaranis&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no; I don&rsquo;t touch the Americas,&rdquo; interposed
Challis. &ldquo;I want all your attention, Elmer. This is
important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come into my study,&rdquo; said Elmer, &ldquo;and let us have
the facts. What will you have&mdash;tea, whisky, beer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Challis&rsquo;s r&eacute;sum&eacute; of the facts need not be
reported. When it was accomplished, Elmer put several keen questions,
and finally delivered his verdict thus:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must see the boy, Challis. Personally I am, of course,
satisfied, but we must not give Crashaw opportunity to raise endless
questions, as he can and will. There is Mayor Purvis, the grocer, to be
reckoned with, you must remember. He represents a powerful
Nonconformist influence. Crashaw will get hold of him&mdash;and work
him if we see Purvis first. Purvis always stiffens his neck against any
breach of conventional procedure. If Crashaw saw him first, well and
good, Purvis would immediately jump to the conclusion that Crashaw
intended some subtle attack on the Nonconformist position, and would
side with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I know Purvis,&rdquo; mused Challis.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb193" href="#pb193" name=
"pb193">193</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Purvis &amp; Co. in the Square,&rdquo; prompted Elmer.
&ldquo;Black-and-white fellow; black moustache and side whiskers, black
eyes and white face. There&rsquo;s a suggestion of the Methodist pulpit
about him. Doesn&rsquo;t appear in the shop much, and when he does,
always looks as if he&rsquo;d sooner sell you a Bible than a bottle of
whisky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes! I know,&rdquo; said Challis. &ldquo;I daresay
you&rsquo;re right, Elmer; but it will be difficult to persuade this
child to answer any questions his examiners may put to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely he must be open to reason,&rdquo; roared Elmer.
&ldquo;You tell me he has an extraordinary intelligence, and in the
next sentence you imply that the child&rsquo;s a fool who can&rsquo;t
open his mouth to serve his own interests. What&rsquo;s your
paradox?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sublimated material. Intellectual insight and absolute
spiritual blindness,&rdquo; replied Challis, getting to his feet.
&ldquo;The child has gone too far in one direction&mdash;in another he
has made not one step. His mind is a magnificent, terrible machine. He
has the imagination of a mathematician and a logician developed beyond
all conception, he has not one spark of the imagination of a poet. And
so he cannot deal with men; he can&rsquo;t understand their weaknesses
and limitations; they are geese and hens to him, creatures to be scared
out of his vicinity. However, I will see what I can do. Could you
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb194" href="#pb194" name=
"pb194">194</a>]</span>arrange for the members of the Authority to come
to my place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think so. Yes,&rdquo; said Elmer. &ldquo;I say,
Challis, are you sure you&rsquo;re right about this child? Sounds to me
like some&mdash;some freak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; returned Challis. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
try and arrange an interview. I&rsquo;ll let you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, by the way,&rdquo; said Elmer, &ldquo;you had better
invite Crashaw to be present. He will put Purvis&rsquo;s back up, and
that&rsquo;ll enlist the difficult grocer on our side
probably.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Challis had gone, Elmer stood for a few minutes, thoughtfully
scratching the ample red surface of his wide, clean-shaven cheek.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he ejaculated at last, addressing his
empty study, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; And with that expression
he put all thought of Victor Stott away from him, and sat down to write
an exhaustive article on the necessity for a broader basis in primary
education.</p>

<p class="first">Challis called at the rectory of Stoke-Underhill on
his way back to his own house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I give way,&rdquo; was the characteristic of his attitude to
Crashaw, and the rector suppled his back again, remembered the Derby
office-boy&rsquo;s tendency to brag, and made the amende honorable. He
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb195" href="#pb195" name=
"pb195">195</a>]</span>even overdid his magnanimity and came too near
subservience&mdash;so lasting is the influence of the lessons of
youth.</p>
<p>Crashaw did not mention that in the interval between the two
interviews he had called upon Mr. Purvis in the Square. The ex-mayor
had refused to commit himself to any course of action.</p>
<p>Challis forgot the rectory and all that it connoted before he was
well outside the rectory&rsquo;s front door. Challis had a task before
him that he regarded with the utmost distaste. He had warmly championed
a cause; he had been heated by the presentation of a manifest injustice
which was none the less tyrannical because it was ridiculous. But now
he realised that it was only the abstract question which had aroused
his enthusiastic advocacy, and he shrank from the interview with Victor
Stott&mdash;that small, deliberate, intimidating child.</p>
<p>Henry Challis, the savant, the man of repute in letters, the
respected figure in the larger world; Challis, the proprietor and
landlord; Challis, the power among known men, knew that he would have
to plead, to humble himself, to be prepared for a rebuff&mdash;worst of
all, to acknowledge the justice of taking so undignified a position.
Any aristocrat may stoop with dignity when he condescends of his own
free will; but there are few who can submit gracefully to deserved
contempt. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb196" href="#pb196" name=
"pb196">196</a>]</span></p>
<p>Challis was one of the few. He had many admirable qualities.
Nevertheless, during that short motor ride from Stoke to his own house,
he resented the indignity he anticipated, resented it
intensely&mdash;and submitted.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">He was allowed no respite. Victor Stott was emerging
from the library window as Challis rolled up to the hall door. It was
one of Ellen Mary&rsquo;s days&mdash;she stood respectfully in the
background while her son descended; she curtsied to Challis as he came
forward.</p>
<p>He hesitated a moment. He would not risk insult in the presence of
his chauffeur and Mrs. Stott. He confronted the Wonder; he stood before
him, and over him like a cliff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must speak to you for a moment on a matter of some
importance,&rdquo; said Challis to the little figure below him, and as
he spoke he looked over the child&rsquo;s head at the child&rsquo;s
mother. &ldquo;It is a matter that concerns your own welfare. Will you
come into the house with me for a few minutes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ellen Mary nodded, and Challis understood. He turned and led the
way. At the door, however, he stood aside and spoke again to Mrs.
Stott. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you come in and have some tea, or
something?&rdquo; he asked. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb197" href=
"#pb197" name="pb197">197</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, thank you, sir,&rdquo; replied Ellen Mary;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just wait &rsquo;ere till &rsquo;e&rsquo;s
ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least come in and sit down,&rdquo; said Challis, and she
came in and sat in the hall. The Wonder had already preceded them into
the house. He had walked into the morning-room&mdash;probably because
the door stood open, though he was now tall enough to reach the handles
of the Challis Court doors. He stood in the middle of the room when
Challis entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you sit down?&rdquo; said Challis.</p>
<p>The Wonder shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if you are aware,&rdquo; began Challis,
&ldquo;that there is a system of education in England at the present
time, which requires that every child should attend school at the age
of five years, unless the parents are able to provide their children
with an education elsewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Wonder nodded.</p>
<p>Challis inferred that he need proffer no further information with
regard to the Education Act.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, it is very absurd,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;and I
have, myself, pointed out the absurdity; but there is a man of some
influence in this neighbourhood who insists that you should attend the
elementary school.&rdquo; He paused, but the Wonder gave no sign.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have argued with this man,&rdquo; continued Challis,
&ldquo;and I have also seen another member of the Local <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb198" href="#pb198" name=
"pb198">198</a>]</span>Education Authority&mdash;a man of some note in
the larger world&mdash;and it seems that you cannot be exempted unless
you convince the Authority that your knowledge is such that to give you
a Council school education would be the most absurd farce.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cannot you stand in loco parentis?&rdquo; asked the Wonder
suddenly, in his still, thin voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean,&rdquo; said Challis, startled by this outburst,
&ldquo;that I am in a sense providing you with an education? Quite
true; but there is Crashaw to deal with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Inform him,&rdquo; said the Wonder.</p>
<p>Challis sighed. &ldquo;I have,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but he
can&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo; And then, feeling the urgent need to
explain something of the motives that govern this little world of
ours&mdash;the world into which this strangely logical exception had
been born&mdash;Challis attempted an exposition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that these things must seem to
you utterly absurd, but you must try to realise that you are an
exception to the world about you; that Crashaw or I, or, indeed, the
greatest minds of the present day, are not ruled by the fine logic
which you are able to exercise. We are children compared to you. We are
swayed even in the making of our laws by little primitive emotions and
passions, self-interests, desires. And at the best we are not capable
of ordering our lives and our government to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb199" href="#pb199" name=
"pb199">199</a>]</span>those just ends which we may see, some of us,
are abstractly right and fine. We are at the mercy of that great mass
of the people who have not yet won to an intellectual and
discriminating judgment of how their own needs may best be served, and
whose representatives consider the interests of a party, a
constituency, and especially of their own personal ambitions and
welfare, before the needs of humanity as a whole, or even the humanity
of these little islands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Above all, we are divided man against man. We are split into
parties and factions, by greed and jealousies, petty spites and
self-seeking, by unintelligence, by education, and by our
inability&mdash;a mental inability&mdash;&lsquo;to see life steadily
and see it whole,&rsquo; and lastly, perhaps chiefly, by our intense
egotisms, both physical and intellectual.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try to realise this. It is necessary, because whatever your
wisdom, you have to live in a world of comparative ignorance, a world
which cannot appreciate you, but which can and will fall back upon the
compelling power of the savage&mdash;the resort to physical, brute
force.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Wonder nodded. &ldquo;You suggest&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Merely that you should consent to answer certain elementary
questions which the members of the Local Authority will put to
you,&rdquo; replied Challis. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb200" href=
"#pb200" name="pb200">200</a>]</span>&ldquo;I can arrange that these
questions be asked here&mdash;in the library. Will you
consent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Wonder nodded, and made his way into the hall, without another
word. His mother rose and opened the front door for him.</p>
<p>As Challis watched the curious couple go down the drive, he sighed
again, perhaps with relief, perhaps at the impotence of the world of
men.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There were four striking figures on the Education
Committee selected by the Ailesworth County Council.</p>
<p>The first of these was Sir Deane Elmer, who was also chairman of the
Council at this time. The second was the vice-chairman, Enoch Purvis,
the ex-mayor, commonly, if incorrectly, known as &ldquo;Mayor&rdquo;
Purvis.</p>
<p>The third was Richard Standing, J.P., who owned much property on the
Quainton side of the town. He was a bluff, hearty man, devoted to sport
and agriculture; a Conservative by birth and inclination, a staunch
upholder of the Church and the Tariff Reform movement.</p>
<p>The fourth was the Rev. Philip Steven, a co-opted member of the
Committee, head master of the Ailesworth Grammar School. Steven was a
tall, thin <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb201" href="#pb201" name=
"pb201">201</a>]</span>man with bent shoulders, and he had a long, thin
face, the length of which was exaggerated by his square brown beard. He
wore gold-mounted spectacles which, owing to his habit of dropping his
head, always needed adjustment whenever he looked up. The movement of
lifting his head and raising his hand to his glasses had become so
closely associated, that his hand went up even when there was no
apparent need for the action. Steven spoke of himself as a Broad
Churchman, and in his speech on prize-day he never omitted some
allusion to the necessity for &ldquo;marching&rdquo; or &ldquo;keeping
step&rdquo; with the times. But Elmer was inclined to laugh at this
assumption of modernity. &ldquo;Steven,&rdquo; he said, on one
occasion, &ldquo;marks time and thinks he is keeping step. And every
now and then he runs a little to catch up.&rdquo; The point of
Elmer&rsquo;s satire lay in the fact that Steven was usually to be seen
either walking very slowly, head down, lost in abstraction;
or&mdash;when aroused to a sense of present necessity&mdash;going with
long strides as if intent on catching up with the times without further
delay. Very often, too, he might be seen running across the school
playground, his hand up to those elusive glasses of his. &ldquo;There
goes Mr. Steven, catching up with the times,&rdquo; had become an
accepted phrase.</p>
<p>There were other members of the Education Committee, notably Mrs.
Philip Steven, but they were <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb202" href=
"#pb202" name="pb202">202</a>]</span>subordinate. If those four
striking figures were unanimous, no other member would have dreamed of
expressing a contrary opinion. But up to this time they had not yet
been agreed upon any important line of action.</p>
<p>This four, Challis and Crashaw met in the morning-room of Challis
Court one Thursday afternoon in early June. Elmer had brought a
stenographer with him for scientific purposes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Challis, when they were all assembled.
&ldquo;The&mdash;the subject&mdash;I mean, Victor Stott is in the
library. Shall we adjourn?&rdquo; Challis had not felt so nervous since
the morning before he had sat for honours in the Cambridge Senate
House.</p>
<p>In the library they found a small child, reading.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">He did not look up when the procession entered, nor
did he remove his cricket cap. He was in his usual place at the centre
table.</p>
<p>Challis found chairs for the Committee, and the members ranged
themselves round the opposite side of the table. Curiously, the effect
produced was that of a class brought up for a viva voce examination,
and when the Wonder raised his eyes and glanced deliberately down the
line of his judges, this effect <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb203"
href="#pb203" name="pb203">203</a>]</span>was heightened. There was an
audible fidgeting, a creak of chairs, an indication of small
embarrassments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her&mdash;um!&rdquo; Deane Elmer cleared his throat with
noisy vigour; looked at the Wonder, met his eyes and looked hastily
away again; &ldquo;Hm!&mdash;her&mdash;rum!&rdquo; he repeated, and
then he turned to Challis. &ldquo;So this little fellow has never been
to school?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Challis frowned heavily. He looked exceedingly uncomfortable and
unhappy. He was conscious that he could take neither side in this
controversy&mdash;that he was in sympathy with no one of the seven
other persons who were seated in his library.</p>
<p>He shook his head impatiently in answer to Sir Deane Elmer&rsquo;s
question, and the chairman turned to the Rev. Philip Steven, who was
gazing intently at the pattern of the carpet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think, Steven,&rdquo; said Elmer, &ldquo;that your large
experience will probably prompt you to a more efficient examination
than we could conduct. Will you initiate the inquiry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steven raised his head slightly, put a readjusting hand up to his
glasses, and then looked sternly at the Wonder over the top of them.
Even the sixth form quailed when the head master assumed this
expression, but the small child at the table was gazing out of the
window. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb204" href="#pb204" name=
"pb204">204</a>]</span></p>
<p>Doubtless Steven was slightly embarrassed by the detachment of the
examinee, and blundered. &ldquo;What is the square root of 226?&rdquo;
he asked&mdash;he probably intended to say 225.</p>
<p>&ldquo;15&middot;03329&mdash;to five places,&rdquo; replied the
Wonder.</p>
<p>Steven started. Neither he nor any other member of the Committee was
capable of checking that answer without resort to pencil and paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; ejaculated Squire Standing.</p>
<p>Elmer scratched the superabundance of his purple jowl, and looked at
Challis, who thrust his hands into his pockets and stared at the
ceiling.</p>
<p>Crashaw leaned forward and clasped his hands together. He was biding
his time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mayor&rdquo; Purvis alone seemed unmoved. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
that book he&rsquo;s got open in front of him?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I see?&rdquo; interposed Challis hurriedly, and he rose
from his chair, picked up the book in question, glanced at it for a
moment, and then handed it to the grocer. The book was Van
Vloten&rsquo;s Dutch text and Latin translation of Spinoza&rsquo;s
Short Treatise.</p>
<p>The grocer turned to the title-page.
&ldquo;Ad&mdash;beany&mdash;dick&mdash;ti&mdash;de&mdash;Spy&mdash;nozer,&rdquo;
he read aloud and then: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s it all about, Mr.
Challis?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;German or something, I take
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In any case it has nothing to do with elementary <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb205" href="#pb205" name=
"pb205">205</a>]</span>arithmetic,&rdquo; replied Challis curtly,
&ldquo;Mr. Steven will set your mind at ease on that point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, certainly,&rdquo; murmured Steven.</p>
<p>Grocer Purvis closed the book carefully and replaced it on the desk.
&ldquo;What does half a stone o&rsquo; loaf sugar at
two-three-farthings come to?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>The Wonder shook his head. He did not understand the grocer&rsquo;s
phraseology.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is seven times two and three quarters?&rdquo; translated
Challis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;19&middot;25,&rdquo; answered the Wonder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that in shillin&rsquo;s?&rdquo; asked
Purvis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;1&middot;60416.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wrong!&rdquo; returned the grocer triumphantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Er&mdash;excuse me, Mr. Purvis,&rdquo; interposed Steven,
&ldquo;I think not. The&mdash;the&mdash;er&mdash;examinee has given the
correct mathematical answer to five places of decimals&mdash;that is,
so far as I can check him mentally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it seems to me,&rdquo; persisted the grocer, &ldquo;as
he&rsquo;s gone a long way round to answer a simple question what any
fifth-standard child could do in his head. I&rsquo;ll give him
another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cast it in another form,&rdquo; put in the chairman.
&ldquo;Give it as a multiplication sum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Purvis tucked his fingers carefully into his waistcoat pockets.
&ldquo;I put the question, Mr. Chairman,&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb206" href="#pb206" name="pb206">206</a>]</span>he
said, &ldquo;as it&rsquo;ll be put to the youngster when he has to tot
up a bill. That seems to be a sound and practical form for such
questions to be put in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Challis sighed impatiently. &ldquo;I thought Mr. Steven had been
delegated to conduct the first part of the examination,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;It seems to me that we are wasting a lot of time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elmer nodded. &ldquo;Will you go on, Mr. Steven?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Challis was ashamed for his compeers. &ldquo;What children we
are,&rdquo; he thought.</p>
<p>Steven got to work again with various arithmetical questions, which
were answered instantly, and then he made a sudden leap and asked:
&ldquo;What is the binomial theorem?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A formula for writing down the coefficient of any stated term
in the expansion of any stated power of a given binomial,&rdquo;
replied the Wonder.</p>
<p>Elmer blew out his cheeks and looked at Challis, but met the gaze of
Mr. Steven, who adjusted his glasses and said, &ldquo;I am satisfied
under this head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all beyond me,&rdquo; remarked Squire Standing
frankly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think, Mr. Chairman, that we&rsquo;ve had enough
theoretical arithmetic,&rdquo; said Purvis. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a few
practical questions I&rsquo;d like to put.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more arithmetic, then,&rdquo; assented Elmer, and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb207" href="#pb207" name=
"pb207">207</a>]</span>Crashaw exchanged a glance of understanding with
the grocer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, how old was our Lord when He began His ministry?&rdquo;
asked the grocer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncertain,&rdquo; replied the Wonder.</p>
<p>Mr. Purvis smiled. &ldquo;Any Sunday-school child knows that!&rdquo;
he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, of course,&rdquo; murmured Crashaw.</p>
<p>But Steven looked uncomfortable. &ldquo;Are you sure you understand
the purport of the answer, Mr. Purvis?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can there be any doubt about it?&rdquo; replied the grocer.
&ldquo;I asked how old our Lord was when He began His ministry, and
he&rdquo;&mdash;he made an indicative gesture with one momentarily
released hand towards the Wonder&mdash;&ldquo;and he says he&rsquo;s
&lsquo;uncertain.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; interposed Challis impatiently, &ldquo;he
meant that the answer to your question was uncertain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; returned the grocer.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always understood&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite, quite,&rdquo; interrupted Challis. &ldquo;But what we
have always understood does not always correspond to the actual
fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you intend by your answer?&rdquo; put in Elmer
quickly, addressing the Wonder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The evidence rests mainly on <a class="biblink xd26e45"
title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%203:23&amp;version=NRSV">
Luke&rsquo;s Gospel</a>,&rdquo; answered the Wonder, &ldquo;but the
phrase <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb208" href="#pb208" name=

&tau;&rho;&iota;&#8049;&kappa;&omicron;&nu;&tau;&alpha;</span></span>&rsquo;
is vague&mdash;it allows latitude in either direction. According to the
chronology of John&rsquo;s Gospel the age might have been about
thirty-two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It says &lsquo;thirty&rsquo; in the Bible, and that&rsquo;s
good enough for me,&rdquo; said the grocer, and Crashaw muttered
&ldquo;Heresy, heresy,&rdquo; in an audible under tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds very like blarsphemy to me,&rdquo; said Purvis,
&ldquo;like doubtin&rsquo; the word of God. I&rsquo;m for sending him
to school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Deane Elmer had been regarding the face of the small abstracted
child with considerable interest. He put aside for the moment the
grocer&rsquo;s intimation of his voting tendency.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many elements are known to chemists?&rdquo; asked Elmer
of the examinee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eighty-one well characterised; others have been
described,&rdquo; replied the Wonder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which has the greatest atomic weight?&rdquo; asked Elmer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uranium.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that weight is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the oxygen basis of 16&mdash;238&middot;5.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Extraordinary powers of memory,&rdquo; muttered Elmer, and
there was silence for a moment, a silence broken by Squire Standing,
who, in a loud voice, asked suddenly and most irrelevantly,
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your opinion of Tariff Reform?&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb209" href="#pb209" name="pb209">209</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;An empirical question that cannot be decided from a
theoretical basis,&rdquo; replied the Wonder.</p>
<p>Elmer laughed out, a great shouting guffaw. &ldquo;Quite right,
quite right,&rdquo; he said, his cheeks shaking with mirth. &ldquo;What
have you to say to that, Standing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say that Tariff Reform&rsquo;s the only way to save the
country,&rdquo; replied Squire Standing, looking very red and
obstinate, &ldquo;and if this Government&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Challis rose to his feet. &ldquo;Oh! aren&rsquo;t you all
satisfied?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Is this Committee here to argue
questions of present politics? What more evidence do you
need?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not satisfied,&rdquo; put in Purvis resolutely,
&ldquo;nor is the Rev. Mr. Crashaw, I fancy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has no vote,&rdquo; said Challis. &ldquo;Elmer, what do
you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we may safely say that the child has been, and is
being, provided with an education elsewhere, and that he need not
therefore attend the elementary school,&rdquo; replied Elmer, still
chuckling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On a point of order, Mr. Chairman, is that what you put to
the meeting?&rdquo; asked Purvis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is quite informal,&rdquo; replied Elmer. &ldquo;Unless
we are all agreed, the question must be put to the full
Committee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we argue the point in the other room?&rdquo; suggested
Challis. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb210" href="#pb210" name=
"pb210">210</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, certainly,&rdquo; said Elmer. &ldquo;We can
return, if necessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the four striking figures of the Education Committee filed out,
followed by Crashaw and the stenographer.</p>
<p>Challis, coming last, paused at the door and looked back.</p>
<p>The Wonder had returned to his study of Spinoza.</p>
<p>Challis waved a hand to the unconscious figure. &ldquo;I must join
my fellow-children,&rdquo; he said grimly, &ldquo;or they will be
quarrelling.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="first">But when he joined his fellow-children, Challis stood
at the window of the morning-room, attending little to the buzz of
voices and the clatter of glasses which marked the relief from the
restraint of the examination-room. Even the stenographer was talking;
he had joined Crashaw and Purvis&mdash;a lemonade group; the other
three were drinking whisky. The division, however, is arbitrary, and in
no way significant.</p>
<p>Challis caught a fragment of the conversation here and there: a
bull-roar from Elmer or Squire Standing; an occasional blatancy from
Purvis; a vibrant protest from Crashaw; a hesitating tenor
pronouncement from Steven. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb211" href=
"#pb211" name="pb211">211</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Extraordinary powers of memory&#8202;&hellip;. It isn&rsquo;t
facts, but what they stand for that I&#8202;&hellip;. Don&rsquo;t know
his Bible&mdash;that&rsquo;s good enough for me&#8202;&hellip;. Heresy,
heresy&#8202;&hellip;. A phenomenal memory, of course, quite
phenomenal, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The simple exposition of each man&rsquo;s theme was dogmatically
asserted, and through it all Challis, standing alone, hardly conscious
of each individual utterance, was still conscious that the spirits of
those six men were united in one thing, had they but known it. Each was
endeavouring to circumscribe the powers of the child they had just
left&mdash;each was insistent on some limitation he chose to regard as
vital.</p>
<p>They came to no decision that afternoon. The question as to whether
the Authority should prosecute or not had to be referred to the
Committee.</p>
<p>At the last, Crashaw entered his protest and announced once more
that he would fight the point to the bitter end.</p>
<p>Crashaw&rsquo;s religious hatred was not, perhaps, altogether free
from a sense of affronted dignity, but it was nevertheless a force to
be counted; and he had that obstinacy of the bigot which has in the
past contributed much fire and food to the pyre of martyrdom. He had,
too, a power of initiative within certain limits. It is true that the
bird on a free wing could avoid him with contemptuous ease,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href="#pb212" name=
"pb212">212</a>]</span>but along his own path he was a terrifying
juggernaut. Crashaw, thus circumscribed, was a power, a moving
force.</p>
<p>But now he was seeking to crush, not some paralysed rabbit on the
road, but an elusive spirit of swiftness which has no name, but may be
figured as the genius of modernity. The thing he sought to obliterate
ran ahead of him with a smiling facility and spat rearwards a vaporous
jet of ridicule.</p>
<p>Crashaw might crush his clerical wideawake over his frowning
eyebrows, arm himself with a slightly dilapidated umbrella, and seek
with long, determined strides the members of the Local Education
Authority, but far ahead of him had run an intelligence that
represented the instructed common sense of modernity.</p>
<p>It was for Crashaw to realise&mdash;as he never could and never did
realise&mdash;that he was no longer the dominant force of progress;
that he had been outstripped, left toiling and shouting vain words on a
road that had served its purpose, and though it still remained and was
used as a means of travel, was becoming year by year more antiquated
and despised.</p>
<p>Crashaw toiled to the end, and no one knows how far his personal
purpose and spite were satisfied, but he could never impede any more
that elusive spirit of swiftness; it had run past him. <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Meanwhile a child of five&mdash;all unconscious that
he was being represented to various members of the Local Education
Authority as a prot&eacute;g&eacute; under the especial care and
tutelage of the greatest of local magnates&mdash;ran through a
well-kept index of the books in the library of Challis Court&mdash;an
index written clearly on cards that occupied a great nest of accessible
drawers; two cards with a full description to each book, alphabetically
arranged, one card under the title of the work and one under the
author&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>The child made no notes as he studied&mdash;he never wrote a single
line in all his life; but when a drawer of that delightful index had
been searched, he would walk here and there among the three rooms at
his disposal, and by the aid of the flight of framed steps that ran
smoothly on rubber-tyred wheels, he would take down now and again some
book or another until, returning to the table at last to read,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb214" href="#pb214" name=
"pb214">214</a>]</span>he sat in an enceinte of piled volumes that had
been collected round him.</p>
<p>Sometimes he read a book from beginning to end, more often he
glanced through it, turning a dozen pages at a time, and then pushed it
on one side with a gesture displaying the contempt that was not shown
by any change of expression.</p>
<p>On many afternoons the sombrely clad figure of a tall, gaunt woman
would stand at the open casement of a window in the larger room, and
keep a mystic vigil that sometimes lasted for hours. She kept her gaze
fixed on that strange little figure whenever it roved up and down the
suite of rooms or clambered the pyramid of brown steps that might have
made such a glorious plaything for any other child. And even when her
son was hidden behind the wall of volumes he had built, the woman would
still stare in his direction, but then her eyes seemed to look inwards;
at such times she appeared to be wrapped in an introspective
devotion.</p>
<p>Very rarely, the heavy-shouldered figure of a man would come to the
doorway of the larger room, and also keep a silent vigil&mdash;a man
who would stand for some minutes with thoughtful eyes and bent brows
and then sigh, shake his head and move away, gently closing the door
behind him.</p>
<p>There were few other interruptions to the silence of that
chapel-like library. Half a dozen times in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb215" href="#pb215" name="pb215">215</a>]</span>the
first few months a fair-haired, rather supercilious young man came and
fetched away a few volumes; but even he evidenced an inclination to
walk on tip-toe, a tendency that mastered him whenever he forgot for a
moment his self-imposed r&ocirc;le of scorn&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Outside, over the swelling undulations of rich grass the sheep came
back with close-cropped, ungainly bodies to a land that was yellow with
buttercups. But when one looked again, their wool hung about them, and
they were snatching at short turf that was covered at the wood-side by
a sprinkle of brown leaves. Then the sheep have gone, and the wood is
black with February rain, and again the unfolding of the year is about
us; a thickening of high twigs in the wood, a glint of green on the
blackthorn&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Nearly three cycles of death and birth have run their course, and
then the strange little figure comes no more to the library at Challis
Court. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb217" href="#pb217" name=

<p class="first">The circumstance that had intrigued me for so long was
determined with an abruptness only less remarkable than the surprise of
the onset. Two deaths within six months brought to me, the first, a
competence, the second, release from gall and bitterness. For the first
time in my life I was a free man. At forty one can still look forward,
and I put the past behind me and made plans for the future. There was
that book of mine still waiting to be written.</p>
<p>It was wonderful how the detail of it all came back to me&mdash;the
plan of it, the thread of development, even the very phrases that I had
toyed with. The thought of the book brought back a train of
associations. There was a phrase I had coined as I had walked out from
Ailesworth to Stoke-Underhill; a chapter I had roughed out the day I
went to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb220" href="#pb220" name=
"pb220">220</a>]</span>see Ginger Stott at Pym. It seemed to me that
the whole conception of the book was associated in some way with that
neighbourhood. I remembered at last that I had first thought of writing
it after my return from America, on the day that I had had that curious
experience with the child in the train. It occurred to me that by a
reversal of the process, I might regain many more of my original
thoughts; that by going to live, temporarily perhaps, in the
neighbourhood of Ailesworth, I might revive other associations.</p>
<p>The picture of Pym presented itself to me very clearly. I remembered
that I had once thought that Pym was a place to which I might retire
one day in order to write the things I wished to write. I decided to
make the dream a reality, and I wrote to Mrs. Berridge at the Wood
Farm, asking her if she could let me have her rooms for the spring,
summer, and autumn.</p>

<p class="first">I was all aglow with excitement on the morning that I
set out for the Hampden Hills. This was change, I thought, freedom,
adventure. This was the beginning of life, my real entry into the joy
of living.</p>
<p>The world was alight with the fire of growth. May had come with a
clear sky and a torrent of green <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb221"
href="#pb221" name="pb221">221</a>]</span>was flowing over field,
hedge, and wood. I remember that I thanked &ldquo;whatever gods there

things.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Farmer Bates met me at Great Hittenden Station. His
was the only available horse and cart at Pym, for the Berridges were in
a very small way, and it is doubtful if they could have made both ends
meet if Mrs. Berridge had not done so well by letting her two spare
rooms.</p>
<p>I have a great admiration for Farmer Bates and Mrs. Berridge. I
regret intensely that they should both have been unhappily married. If
they had married each other they would undoubtedly have made a success
of life.</p>
<p>Bates was a Cockney by birth, but always he had had an ambition to
take a farm, and after twenty years of work as a skilled mechanic he
had thrown up a well-paid job, and dared the uncertainties which beset
the English farmer. That venture was a constant bone of strife between
him and his wife. Mrs. Bates preferred the town. It has always seemed
to me that there was something fine about Bates and his love for the
land.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good growing weather, Mr. Bates,&rdquo; I said, as I climbed
up into the cart. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb222" href="#pb222"
name="pb222">222</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t be sorry to see some more rain,&rdquo;
replied Bates, and damped my ardour for a moment.</p>
<p>Just before we turned into the lane that leads up the long hill to
Pym, we passed a ramshackle cart, piled up with a curious miscellany of
ruinous furniture. A man was driving, and beside him sat a slatternly
woman and a repulsive-looking boy of ten or twelve years old, with a
great swollen head and an open, slobbering mouth.</p>
<p>I was startled. I jumped to the conclusion that this was the child I
had seen in the train, the son of Ginger Stott.</p>
<p>As we slowed down to the ascent of the long hill, I said to Bates:
&ldquo;Is that Stott&rsquo;s boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bates looked at me curiously. &ldquo;Why, no,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Them&rsquo;s the &rsquo;Arrisons. &rsquo;Arrison&rsquo;s dead
now; he was a wrong &rsquo;un, couldn&rsquo;t make a job of it, nohow.
They used to live &rsquo;ere, five or six year ago, and now &rsquo;er
&rsquo;usband&rsquo;s dead, Mrs. &rsquo;Arrison&rsquo;s coming back
with the boy to live. Worse luck! We thought we was shut of
&rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;The boy&rsquo;s an idiot, I
suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Orrible,&rdquo; replied Bates, shaking his head,
&ldquo;&rsquo;orrible; can&rsquo;t speak nor nothing; goes about
bleating and baa-ing like an old sheep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked round, but the ramshackle cart was <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb223" href="#pb223" name=
"pb223">223</a>]</span>hidden by the turn of the road. &ldquo;Does
Stott still live at Pym?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not Ginger,&rdquo; replied Bates. &ldquo;He lives at
Ailesworth. Mrs. Stott and &rsquo;er son lives here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boy&rsquo;s still alive then?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Bates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Intelligent child?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They say,&rdquo; replied Bates. &ldquo;Book-learnin&rsquo;
and such. They say &rsquo;e&rsquo;s read every book in Mr.
Challis&rsquo;s librairy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does he go to school?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. They let &rsquo;im off. Leastways Mr. Challis did. They
say the Reverend Crashaw, down at Stoke, was fair put out about
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I thought that Bates emphasised the &ldquo;on dit&rdquo; nature of
his information rather markedly. &ldquo;What do you think of
him?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me?&rdquo; said Bates. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t worry my
&rsquo;ead about him. I&rsquo;ve got too much to <i>do</i>.&rdquo; And
he went off into technicalities concerning the abundance of charlock on
the arable land of Pym. He called it &ldquo;garlic.&rdquo; I saw that
it was typical of Bates that he should have too much to <i>do</i>. I
reflected that his was the calling which begot civilisation.</p>

<p class="first">The best and surest route from Pym to the Wood Farm
is, appropriately, by way of the wood; but <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb224" href="#pb224" name="pb224">224</a>]</span>in
wet weather the alternative of various cart tracks that wind among the
bracken and shrub of the Common, is preferable in many ways. May had
been very dry that year, however, and Farmer Bates chose the wood. The
leaves were still light on the beeches. I remember that as I tried to
pierce the vista of stems that dipped over the steep fall of the hill,
I promised myself many a romantic exploration of the unknown mysteries
beyond.</p>
<p>Everything was so bright that afternoon that nothing, I believe,
could have depressed me. When I looked round the low, dark room with
its one window, a foot from the ground and two from the ceiling, I only
thought that I should be out-of-doors all the time. It amused me that I
could touch the ceiling with my head by standing on tiptoe, and I
laughed at the framed &ldquo;presentation plates&rdquo; from old
Christmas numbers on the walls. These things are merely curious when
the sun is shining and it is high May, and one is free to do the
desired work after twenty years in a galley.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">At a quarter to eight that evening I saw the sun set
behind the hills. As I wandered reflectively down the lane that goes
towards Challis Court, a blackbird was singing ecstatically in a high
elm; here and there a rabbit popped out and sat up, the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb225" href="#pb225" name=
"pb225">225</a>]</span>picture of precocious curiosity. Nature seemed
to be standing in her doorway for a careless half-hour&rsquo;s gossip,
before putting up the shutters to bar the robbers who would soon be
about their work of the night.</p>
<p>It was still quite light as I strolled back over the Common, and I
chose a path that took me through a little spinney of ash, oak, and
beech, treading carefully to avoid crushing the tender crosiers of
bracken that were just beginning to break their way through the
soil.</p>
<p>As I emerged from the little clump of wood, I saw two figures going
away from me in the direction of Pym.</p>
<p>One was that of a boy wearing a cricket-cap; he was walking
deliberately, his hands hanging at his sides; the other figure was a
taller boy, and he threw out his legs in a curious, undisciplined way,
as though he had little control over them. At first sight I thought he
was not sober.</p>
<p>The two passed out of sight behind a clump of hawthorn, but once I
saw the smaller figure turn and face the other, and once he made a
repelling gesture with his hands.</p>
<p>It occurred to me that the smaller boy was trying to avoid his
companion; that he was, in one sense, running away from him, that he
walked as one might walk away from some threatening <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb226" href="#pb226" name=
"pb226">226</a>]</span>animal, deliberately&mdash;to simulate the
appearance of courage.</p>
<p>I fancied the bigger boy was the idiot Harrison I had seen that
afternoon, and Farmer Bates&rsquo;s &ldquo;We hoped we were shut of
him,&rdquo; recurred to me. I wondered if the idiot were dangerous or
only a nuisance.</p>
<p>I took the smaller boy to be one of the villagers&rsquo; children. I
noticed that his cricket-cap had a dark patch as though it had been
mended with some other material.</p>
<p>The impression which I received from this trivial affair was one of
disappointment. The wood and the Common had been so deserted by
humanity, so given up to nature, that I felt the presence of the idiot
to be a most distasteful intrusion. &ldquo;If that horrible thing is
going to haunt the Common there will be no peace or decency,&rdquo; was
the idea that presented itself. &ldquo;I must send him off, the
brute,&rdquo; was the rider. But I disliked the thought of being
obliged to drive him away.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<div class="divHead">

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The next morning I did not go on the Common; I was
anxious to avoid a meeting with the Harrison idiot. I had been debating
whether I should drive him away if I met him. Obviously I had no more
right on the Common than he had&mdash;on the other <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb227" href="#pb227" name=
"pb227">227</a>]</span>hand, he was a nuisance, and I did not see why I
should allow him to spoil all my pleasure in that ideal stretch of wild
land which pressed on three sides of the Wood Farm. It was a stupid
quandary of my own making; but I am afraid it was rather typical of my
mental attitude. I am prone to set myself tasks, such as this eviction
of the idiot from common ground, and equally prone to avoid them by a
process of procrastination.</p>
<p>By way of evasion I walked over to Deane Hill and surveyed the
wonderful panorama of neat country that fills the basin between the
Hampden and the Quainton Hills. Seen from that height, it has something
the effect of a Dutch landscape, it all looks so amazingly tidy. Away
to the left I looked over Stoke-Underhill. Ailesworth was a blur in the
hollow, but I could distinguish the high fence of the County
Ground.</p>
<p>I sat all the morning on Deane Hill, musing and smoking, thinking of
such things as Ginger Stott, and the match with Surrey. I decided that
I must certainly go and see Stott&rsquo;s queer son, the phenomenon who
had, they say, read all the books in Mr. Challis&rsquo;s library. I
wondered what sort of a library this Challis had, and who he was. I had
never heard of him before. I think I must have gone to sleep for a
time.</p>
<p>When Mrs. Berridge came to clear away my <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb228" href="#pb228" name=
"pb228">228</a>]</span>dinner&mdash;I dined, without shame, at
half-past twelve&mdash;I detained her with conversation. Presently I
asked about little Stott.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a queer one, that&rsquo;s what he is,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Berridge. She was a neat, comely little woman, rather superior to
her station, and it seemed to me, certainly superior to her clod of a
husband.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A great reader, Farmer Bates tells me,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>Mrs. Berridge passed that by. &ldquo;His mother&rsquo;s in trouble
about him this morning,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s such a
nice, respectable woman, and has all her milk and eggs and butter off
of us. She was here this morning while you were out, sir, and, what I
could make of it that &rsquo;Arrison boy had been chasing her boy on
the Common last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; I said with sudden enlightenment. &ldquo;I believe
I saw them.&rdquo; At the back of my mind I was struggling desperately
with a vague remembrance. It may sound incredible, but I had only the
dimmest memory of my later experience of the child. The train incident
was still fresh in my mind, but I could not remember what Stott had
told me when I talked with him by the pond. I seemed to have an
impression that the child had some strange power of keeping people at a
distance; or was I mixing up reality with some Scandinavian fairy
tale?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very likely, sir,&rdquo; Mrs. Berridge went on. &ldquo;What
upset Mrs. Stott was that her boy&rsquo;s never <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb229" href="#pb229" name=
"pb229">229</a>]</span>upset by anything&mdash;he has a curious way of
looking at you, sir, that makes you wish you wasn&rsquo;t there; but
from what Mrs. Stott says, this &rsquo;Arrison boy wasn&rsquo;t to be
drove off, anyhow, and her son came in quite flurried like. Mrs. Stott
seemed quite put out about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doubtless I might have had more information from my landlady, but I
was struggling to reconstruct that old experience which had slipped
away from me, and I turned back to the book I had been pretending to
read. Mrs. Berridge was one of those unusual women&mdash;for her
station in life&mdash;who know when to be silent, and she finished her
clearing away without initiating any further remarks.</p>
<p>When she had finished I went out on to the Common and looked for the
pond where I had talked with Ginger Stott.</p>
<p>I found it after a time, and then I began to gather up the threads I
had dropped.</p>
<p>It all came back to me, little by little. I remembered that talk I
had had with him, his very gestures; I remembered how he had spoken of
habits, or the necessity for the lack of them, and that took me back to
the scene in the British Museum Reading-Room, and to my theory. I was
suddenly alive to that old interest again.</p>
<p>I got up and walked eagerly in the direction of Mrs. Stott&rsquo;s
cottage. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb230" href="#pb230" name=

<p class="first">Victor Stott was in his eighth year when I met him for
the third time. I must have stayed longer than I imagined by the pond
on the Common, for Mrs. Stott and her son had had tea, and the boy was
preparing to go out. He stopped when he saw me coming; an unprecedented
mark of recognition, so I have since learned.</p>
<p>As I saw him then, he made a remarkable, but not a repulsively
abnormal figure. His baldness struck one immediately, but it did not
give him a look of age. Then one noticed that his head was unmistakably
out of proportion to his body, yet the disproportion was not nearly so
marked as it had been in infancy. These two things were conspicuous;
the less salient peculiarities were observed later; the curious little
beaky nose that jutted out <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb231" href=
"#pb231" name="pb231">231</a>]</span>at an unusual angle from the face,
the lips that were too straight and determined for a child, the laxity
of the limbs when the body was in repose&mdash;lastly, the eyes.</p>
<p>When I met Victor Stott on this, third, occasion, there can be no
doubt that he had lost something of his original power. This may have
been due to his long sojourn in the world of books, a sojourn that had,
perhaps, altered the strange individuality of his thought; or it may
have been due, in part at least, to his recent recognition of the fact
that the power of his gaze exercised no influence over creatures such
as the Harrison idiot. Nevertheless, though something of the original
force had abated, he still had an extraordinary, and, so far as I can
learn, altogether unprecedented power of enforcing his will without
word or gesture; and I may say here that in those rare moments when
Victor Stott looked me in the face, I seemed to see a rare and
wonderful personality peering out through his eyes. That was the
personality which had, no doubt, spoken to Challis and Lewes through
that long afternoon in the library of Challis Court. Normally one saw a
curious, unattractive, rather repulsive figure of a child; when he
looked at one with that rare look of intention, the man that lived
within that unattractive body was revealed, his insight, his
profundity, his unexampled wisdom. If we mark the difference
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb232" href="#pb232" name=
"pb232">232</a>]</span>between man and animals by a measure of
intelligence, then surely this child was a very god among men.</p>

<p class="first">Victor Stott did not look at me when I entered his
mother&rsquo;s cottage; I saw only the unattractive exterior of him,
and I blundered into an air of patronage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this your boy?&rdquo; I said, when I had greeted her.
&ldquo;I hear he is a great scholar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; replied Ellen Mary quietly. She never
boasted to strangers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t remember me, I suppose?&rdquo; I went on,
foolishly; trying, however, to speak as to an equal. &ldquo;You were in
petticoats the last time I saw you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Wonder was standing by the window, his arms hanging loosely at
his sides; he looked out aslant up the lane; his profile was turned
towards me. He made no answer to my question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, sir, he remembers,&rdquo; replied Ellen Mary.
&ldquo;He never forgets anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I paused, uncomfortably. I was slightly huffed by the boy&rsquo;s
silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have come to spend the summer here,&rdquo; I said at last.
&ldquo;I hope he will come to see me. I have brought a good many books
with me; perhaps he might care to read some of them.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb233" href="#pb233" name=
"pb233">233</a>]</span></p>
<p>I had to talk <i>at</i> the boy; there was no alternative. Inwardly
I was thinking that I had Kant&rsquo;s Critique and Hegel&rsquo;s
Phenomenology among my books. &ldquo;He may put on airs of
scholarship,&rdquo; I thought; &ldquo;but I fancy that he will find
those two works rather above the level of his comprehension as
yet.&rdquo; I did not recognise the fact that it was I who was putting
on airs, not Victor Stott.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;E&rsquo;s given up reading the past six weeks,
sir,&rdquo; said Ellen Mary, &ldquo;but I daresay he will come and see
your books.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She spoke demurely, and she did not look at her son; I received the
impression that her statements were laid before him to take up, reject,
or pass unnoticed as he pleased.</p>
<p>I was slightly exasperated. I turned to the Wonder. &ldquo;Would you
care to come?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>He nodded without looking at me, and walked out of the cottage.</p>
<p>I hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;E&rsquo;ll go with you now, sir,&rdquo; prompted Ellen
Mary. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what &rsquo;e means.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I followed the Wonder in a condition of suppressed irritation.
&ldquo;His mother might be able to interpret his rudeness,&rdquo; I
thought, &ldquo;but I would teach him to convey his intentions more
clearly. The child had been spoilt.&rdquo; <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Wonder chose the road over the Common. I should
have gone by the wood, but when we came to the entrance of the wood, he
turned up on to the Common. He did not ask me which way I preferred.
Indeed, we neither of us spoke during the half-mile walk that separated
the Wood Farm from the last cottage in Pym.</p>
<p>I was fuming inwardly. I had it in my mind at that time to put the
Wonder through some sort of an examination. I was making plans to
contribute towards his education, to send him to Oxford, later. I had
adumbrated a scheme to arouse interest in his case among certain
scholars and men of influence with whom I was slightly acquainted. I
had been very much engrossed with these plans as I had made my way to
the Stotts&rsquo; cottage. I was still somewhat exalted in mind with my
dreams of a vicarious brilliance. I had pictured the Wonder&rsquo;s
magnificent passage though the University; I had acted, in thought, as
the generous and kindly benefactor&#8202;&hellip;. It had been a
grandiose dream, and the reality was so humiliating. Could I make this
mannerless child understand his possibilities? Had he any ambition?</p>
<p>Thinking of these things, I had lagged behind as we crossed the
Common, and when I came to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb235"
href="#pb235" name="pb235">235</a>]</span>gate of the farmyard, the
Wonder was at the door of the house. He did not wait for me, but walked
straight into my sitting-room. When I entered, I found him seated on
the low window-sill, turning over the top layer of books in the large
case which had been opened, but not unpacked. There was no place to put
the books; in fact, I was proposing to have some shelves put up, if
Mrs. Berridge had no objection.</p>
<p>I entered the room in a condition of warm indignation.
&ldquo;Cheek&rdquo; was the word that was in my mind. &ldquo;Confounded
cheek,&rdquo; I muttered. Nevertheless I did not interrupt the boy;
instead, I lit a cigarette, sat down and watched him.</p>
<p>I was sceptical at first. I noted at once the sure touch with which
the boy handled my books, the practised hand that turned the pages, the
quick examination of title-page and the list of contents, the
occasional swift reference to the index, but I did not believe it
possible that any one could read so fast as he read when he did
condescend for a few moments to give his attention to a few consecutive
pages. &ldquo;Was it a pose?&rdquo; I thought, yet he was certainly an
adept in handling the books. I was puzzled, yet I was still
sceptical&mdash;the habit of experience was towards disbelief&mdash;a
boy of seven and a half could not possibly have the mental equipment to
skim all that philosophy&#8202;&hellip;. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb236" href="#pb236" name="pb236">236</a>]</span></p>
<p>My books were being unpacked very quickly. Kant, Hegel, Schelling,
Fichte, Leibnitz, Nietzsche, Hume, Bradley, William James had all been
rejected and were piled on the floor, but he had hesitated longer over
Bergson&rsquo;s <i>Creative Evolution</i>. He really seemed to be
giving that some attention, though he read it&mdash;if he were reading
it&mdash;so fast that the hand which turned the pages hardly rested
between each movement.</p>
<p>When Bergson was sent to join his predecessors, I determined that I
would get some word out of this strange child&mdash;I had never yet
heard him speak, not a single syllable. I determined to brave all
rebuffs. I was prepared for that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; I said, when Bergson was laid down. &ldquo;Well!
What do you make of that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned and looked out of the window.</p>
<p>I came and sat on the end of the table within a few feet of him.
From that position I, too, could see out of the window, and I saw the
figure of the Harrison idiot slouching over the farmyard gate.</p>
<p>A gust of impatience whirled over me. I caught up my stick and went
out quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then,&rdquo; I said, as I came within speaking distance
of the idiot, &ldquo;get away from here. Out with you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The idiot probably understood no word of what I said, but like a dog
he was quick to interpret my <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb237" href=
"#pb237" name="pb237">237</a>]</span>tone and gesture. He made a
revoltingly inhuman sound as he shambled away, a kind of throaty yelp.
I walked back to the house. I could not avoid the feeling that I had
been unnecessarily brutal.</p>
<p>When I returned the Wonder was still staring out of the window; but
though I did not guess it then, the idiot had served my purpose better
than my determination. It was to the idiot that I owed my subsequent
knowledge of Victor Stott. The Wonder had found a use for me. He was
resigned to bear with my feeble mental development, because I was
strong enough to keep at bay that half-animal creature who appeared to
believe that Victor Stott was one of his own kind&mdash;the only one he
had ever met. The idiot in some unimaginable way had inferred a
likeness between himself and the Wonder&mdash;they both had enormous
heads&mdash;and the idiot was the only human being over whom the Wonder
was never able to exercise the least authority.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">I went in and sat down again on the end of the table.
I was rather heated. I lit another cigarette and stared at the Wonder,
who was still looking out of the window.</p>
<p>There was silence for a few seconds, and then he spoke of his own
initiative. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb238" href="#pb238" name=
"pb238">238</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Illustrates the weakness of argument from history and
analogy,&rdquo; he said in a clear, small voice, addressing no one in
particular. &ldquo;Hegel&rsquo;s limitations are qualitatively those of
Harrison, who argues that I and he are similar in kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The proposition was so astounding that I could find no answer
immediately. If the statement had been made in boyish language I should
have laughed at it, but the phraseology impressed me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve read Hegel, then?&rdquo; I asked evasively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Subtract the endeavour to demonstrate a preconceived
hypothesis from any known philosophy,&rdquo; continued the Wonder,
without heeding my question, &ldquo;and the remainder, the only
valuable material, is found to be distorted.&rdquo; He paused as if
waiting for my reply.</p>
<p>How could one answer such propositions as these offhand? I tried,
however, to get at the gist of the sentence, and, as the silence
continued, I said with some hesitation: &ldquo;But it is impossible,
surely, to approach the work of writing, say a philosophy, without some
apprehension of the end in view?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Illogical,&rdquo; replied the Wonder, &ldquo;not philosophy;
a system of trial and error&mdash;to evaluate a complex variable
function.&rdquo; He paused a moment, and then glanced down at the pile
of books on the floor. &ldquo;More millions,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>I think he meant that more millions of books <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb239" href="#pb239" name=
"pb239">239</a>]</span>might be written on this system without arriving
at an answer to the problem, but I admit that I am at a loss, that I
cannot interpret his remarks. I wrote them down within an hour or two
after they were uttered, but I may have made mistakes. The mathematical
metaphor is beyond me. I have no acquaintance with higher
mathematics.</p>
<p>The Wonder had a very expressionless face, but I thought at this
moment that he wore a look of sadness; and that look was one of the
factors which helped me to understand the unbridgeable gulf that lay
between his intellect and mine. I think it was at this moment that I
first began to change my opinion. I had been regarding him as an
unbearable little prig, but it flashed across me as I watched him now,
that his mind and my own might be so far differentiated that he was
unable to convey his thoughts to me. &ldquo;Was it possible,&rdquo; I
wondered, &ldquo;that he had been trying to talk down to my
level?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid I don&rsquo;t quite follow you,&rdquo; I said. I
had intended to question him further, to urge him to explain, but it
came to me that it would be quite hopeless to go on. How can one answer
the unreasoning questions of a child? Here I was the child, though a
child of slightly advanced development. I could appreciate that it was
useless to persist in a futile &ldquo;Why, why?&rdquo; when the answer
could only be given in terms that I could not comprehend. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb240" href="#pb240" name=
"pb240">240</a>]</span>Therefore I hesitated, sighed, and then with
that obstinacy of vanity which creates an image of self-perfection and
refuses to relinquish it, I said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you could explain yourself; not on this particular
point of philosophy, but your life&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; I stopped,
because I did not know how to phrase my demand. What was it, after all,
that I wanted to learn?</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I can&rsquo;t explain,&rdquo; said the Wonder.
&ldquo;There are no data.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I saw that he had accepted my request for explanation in a much
wider sense than I had intended, and I took him up on this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But haven&rsquo;t you any hypothesis?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot work on the system of trial and error,&rdquo;
replied the Wonder.</p>
<p>Our conversation went no further this afternoon, for Mrs. Berridge
came in to lay the cloth. She looked askance, I thought, at the figure
on the window-sill, but she ventured no remark save to ask if I was
ready for my supper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, oh! yes!&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I lay for two, sir?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Berridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you stay and have supper?&rdquo; I said to the Wonder,
but he shook his head, got up and walked out of the room. I watched him
cross the farmyard and make his way over the Common.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; I said to Mrs. Berridge, when the boy
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb241" href="#pb241" name=
"pb241">241</a>]</span>was out of sight, &ldquo;that child is what in
America they call &lsquo;the limit,&rsquo; Mrs. Berridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My landlady put her lips together, shook her head, and shivered
slightly. &ldquo;He gives me the shudders,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p class="first">I neither read nor wrote that evening. I forgot to go
out for a walk at sunset. I sat and pondered until it was time for bed,
and then I pondered myself to sleep. No vision came to me, and I had no
relevant dreams.</p>
<p>The next morning at seven o&rsquo;clock I saw Mrs. Stott come over
the Common to fetch her milk from the farm. I waited until her business
was done, and then I went out and walked back with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to understand about your son,&rdquo; I said by way of
making an opening.</p>
<p>She looked at me quickly. &ldquo;You know, &rsquo;e &rsquo;ardly
ever speaks to me, sir,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>I was staggered for a moment. &ldquo;But you understand him?&rdquo;
I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In some ways, sir,&rdquo; was her answer.</p>
<p>I recognised the direction of the limitation. &ldquo;Ah! we none of
us understand him in all ways,&rdquo; I said, with a touch of
patronage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; replied Ellen Mary. She evidently agreed to
that statement without qualification. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb242" href="#pb242" name="pb242">242</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;But what is he going to do?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;When he
grows up, I mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say, sir. We must leave that to
&rsquo;im.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I accepted the rebuke more mildly than I should have done on the
previous day. &ldquo;He never speaks of his future?&rdquo; I said
feebly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There seemed to be nothing more to say. We had only gone a couple of
hundred yards, but I paused in my walk. I thought I might as well go
back and get my breakfast. But Mrs. Stott looked at me as though she
had something more to say. We stood facing each other on the cart
track.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose I can&rsquo;t be of any use?&rdquo; I asked
vaguely.</p>
<p>Ellen Mary broke suddenly into volubility.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I &rsquo;ope I&rsquo;m not askin&rsquo; too much, sir,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;but there is a way you could &rsquo;elp if you would.
&rsquo;E &rsquo;ardly ever speaks to me, as I&rsquo;ve said, but
I&rsquo;ve been opset about that &rsquo;Arrison boy. &rsquo;E&rsquo;s a
brute beast, sir, if you know what I mean, and
<i>&rsquo;e</i><span class="corr" id="xd26e4001" title=
"Not in source">&rdquo;</span> (she differentiated her pronouns only by
accent, and where there is any doubt I have used italics to indicate
that her son is referred to) &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t seem to &rsquo;ave
the same &rsquo;old on &rsquo;im as <i>&rsquo;e</i> does over others.
It&rsquo;s truth, I am not easy in my mind about it, sir, although
<i>&rsquo;e</i> &rsquo;as never said a word to me, not being afraid of
anything like other children, but &rsquo;e seems to have took
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb243" href="#pb243" name=
"pb243">243</a>]</span>a sort of a fancy to you, sir&rdquo; (I think
this was intended as the subtlest flattery), &ldquo;and if you was to
go with &rsquo;im when &rsquo;e takes &rsquo;is
walks&mdash;&rsquo;e&rsquo;s much in the air, sir, and a great one for
walkin&rsquo;&mdash;I think &rsquo;e&rsquo;d be glad of your
cump&rsquo;ny, though maybe &rsquo;e won&rsquo;t never say it in so
many words. You mustn&rsquo;t mind &rsquo;im being silent, sir;
there&rsquo;s some things we can&rsquo;t understand, and though, as I
say, &rsquo;e &rsquo;asn&rsquo;t said anything to me, it&rsquo;s not
that I&rsquo;m scheming be&rsquo;ind &rsquo;is back, for I know
&rsquo;is meaning without words being necessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She might have said more, but I interrupted her at this point.
&ldquo;Certainly, I will come and fetch him,&rdquo;&mdash;I lapsed
unconsciously into her system of denomination&mdash;&ldquo;this
morning, if you are sure he would like to come out with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m quite sure, sir,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About nine o&rsquo;clock?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would do nicely, sir,&rdquo; she answered.</p>
<p>As I walked back to the farm I was thinking of the life of those two
occupants of the Stotts&rsquo; cottage. The mother who watched her son
in silence, studying his every look and action in order to gather his
meaning; who never asked her son a question nor expected from him any
statement of opinion; and the son wrapped always in that profound
speculation which seemed to be his only mood. What a household!
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb244" href="#pb244" name=

<p class="first">There is nothing to say of that first walk of mine
with the Wonder. I spoke to him once or twice and he answered by
nodding his head; even this notice I now know to have been a special
mark of favour, a condescension to acknowledge his use for me as a
guardian. He did not speak at all on this occasion.</p>
<p>I did not call for him in the afternoon; I had made other plans. I
wanted to see the man Challis, whose library had been at the disposal
of this phenomenal child. Challis might be able to give me further
information. The truth of the matter is that I was in two minds as to
whether I would stay at Pym through the summer, as I had originally
intended. I was not in love with the prospect which the sojourn now
held out for me. If I were to be constituted head nursemaid to Master
Victor Stott, there would remain insufficient time for the progress of
my own book on certain aspects of the growth of the philosophic
method.</p>
<p>I see now, when I look back, that I was not convinced at that time,
that I still doubted the Wonder&rsquo;s <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb245" href="#pb245" name="pb245">245</a>]</span>learning. I may have
classed it as a freakish pedantry, the result of a phenomenal
memory.</p>
<p>Mrs. Berridge had much information to impart on the subject of Henry
Challis. He was her husband&rsquo;s landlord, of course, and his was a
hallowed name, to be spoken with decency and respect. I am afraid I
shocked Mrs. Berridge at the outset by my casual &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s
this man Challis?&rdquo; She certainly atoned by her own manner for my
irreverence; she very obviously tried to impress me. I professed
submission, but was not intimidated, rather my curiosity was
aroused.</p>
<p>Mrs. Berridge was not able to tell me the one thing I most desired
to know, whether the lord of Challis Court was in residence; but it was
not far to walk, and I set out about two o&rsquo;clock.</p>

<p class="first">Challis was getting into his motor as I walked up the
drive. I hurried forward to catch him before the machine was started.
He saw me coming and paused on the doorstep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you want to see me?&rdquo; he asked, as I came up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Challis?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t keep you now,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;but perhaps
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb246" href="#pb246" name=
"pb246">246</a>]</span>you could let me know some time when I could see
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; he said, with the air of a man who is
constantly subjected to annoyance by strangers. &ldquo;But perhaps you
wouldn&rsquo;t mind telling me what it is you wish to see me about? I
might be able to settle it now, at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am staying at the Wood Farm,&rdquo; I began. &ldquo;I am
interested in a very remarkable child&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! take my advice, leave him alone,&rdquo; interrupted
Challis quickly.</p>
<p>I suppose I looked my amazement, for Challis laughed. &ldquo;Oh,
well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;of course you won&rsquo;t take such
spontaneous advice as that. I&rsquo;m in no hurry. Come in.&rdquo; He
took off his heavy overcoat and threw it into the tonneau. &ldquo;Come
round again in an hour,&rdquo; he said to the chauffeur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very good of you,&rdquo; I protested, &ldquo;I
could come quite well at any other time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in no hurry,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;You had
better come to the scene of Victor Stott&rsquo;s operations. He
hasn&rsquo;t been here for six weeks, by the way. Can you throw any
light on his absence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I made a friend that afternoon. When the car came back at four
o&rsquo;clock, Challis sent it away again. &ldquo;I shall probably stay
down here to-night,&rdquo; he said to the butler, and to me: &ldquo;Can
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb247" href="#pb247" name=
"pb247">247</a>]</span>you stay to dinner? I must convince you about
this child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have dined once to-day,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;At half-past
twelve. I have no other excuse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! well,&rdquo; said Challis, &ldquo;you needn&rsquo;t eat,
but I must. Get us something, Heathcote,&rdquo; he said to the butler,
&ldquo;and bring tea here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Much of our conversation after dinner was not relevant to the
subject of the Wonder; we drifted into a long argument upon human
origins which has no place here. But by that time I had been very well
informed as to all the essential facts of the Wonder&rsquo;s childhood,
of his entry into the world of books, of his earlier methods, and of
the significance of that long speech in the library. But at that point
Challis became reserved. He would give me no details.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must forgive me; I can&rsquo;t go into that,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it is so incomparably important,&rdquo; I protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That may be, but you must not question me. The truth of the
matter is that I have a very confused memory of what the boy said, and
the little I might remember, I prefer to leave undisturbed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He piqued my curiosity, but I did not press him. It was so evident
that he did not wish to speak on that head. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb248" href="#pb248" name="pb248">248</a>]</span></p>
<p>He walked up with me to the farm at ten o&rsquo;clock and came into
my room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need not keep you out of bed, Mrs. Berridge,&rdquo; he
said to my flustered landlady. &ldquo;I daresay we shall be up till all
hours. We promise to see that the house is locked up.&rdquo; Mr.
Berridge stood a figure of subservience in the background.</p>
<p>My books were still heaped on the floor. Challis sat down on the
window-sill and looked over some of them. &ldquo;Many of these Master
Stott probably read in my library&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;in German.
Language is no bar to him. He learns a language as you or I would learn
a page of history.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Later on, I remember that we came down to essentials. &ldquo;I must
try and understand something of this child&rsquo;s capacities,&rdquo; I
said in answer to a hint of Challis&rsquo;s that I should leave the
Wonder alone. &ldquo;It seems to me that here we have something which
is of the first importance, of greater importance, indeed, than
anything else in the history of the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t make him speak,&rdquo; said Challis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall try,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I recognise that we cannot
compel him, but I have a certain hold over him. I see from what you
have told me that he has treated me with most unusual courtesy. I
assure you that several times when I spoke to him this morning he
nodded his head.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb249" href=
"#pb249" name="pb249">249</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;A good beginning,&rdquo; laughed Challis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; I went on, &ldquo;how it is
that you are not more interested. It seems to me that this child knows
many things which we have been patiently attempting to discover since
the dawn of civilisation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite,&rdquo; said Challis. &ldquo;I admit that, but &hellip;
well, I don&rsquo;t think I want to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;this key to all
knowledge&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are not ready for it,&rdquo; replied Challis. &ldquo;You
can&rsquo;t teach metaphysics to children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nevertheless my ardour was increased, not abated, by my long talk
with Challis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall go on,&rdquo; I said, as I went out to the farm gate
with him at half-past two in the morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! well,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I shall come over and
see you when I come back.&rdquo; He had told me earlier that he was
going abroad for some months.</p>
<p>We hesitated a moment by the gate, and instinctively we both looked
up at the vault of the sky and the glimmering dust of stars.</p>
<p>The same thought was probably in both our minds, the thought of the
insignificance of this little system that revolves round one of the
lesser lights of the Milky Way, but that thought was not to be
expressed save by some banality, and we did not speak. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb250" href="#pb250" name="pb250">250</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall certainly look you up when I come back,&rdquo; said
Challis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I hope you will,&rdquo; I said lamely.</p>
<p>I watched the loom of his figure against the vague background till I
could distinguish it no longer. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb251"

<p class="first">The memory of last summer is presented to me now as a
series of pictures, some brilliant, others vague, others again so
uncertain that I cannot be sure how far they are true memories of
actual occurrences, and how far they are interwoven with my thoughts
and dreams. I have, for instance, a recollection of standing on Deane
Hill and looking down over the wide panorama of rural England, through
a driving mist of fine rain. This might well be counted among true
memories, were it not for the fact that clearly associated with the
picture is an image of myself grown to enormous dimensions, a Brocken
spectre that threatened the world with titanic gestures of
denouncement, and I seem to remember that this figure was saying:
&ldquo;All life runs through my fingers like a handful of dry
sand.&rdquo; And yet the remembrance has not the quality of a dream.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb252" href="#pb252" name=
"pb252">252</a>]</span></p>
<p>I was, undoubtedly, overwrought at times. There were days when the
sight of a book filled me with physical nausea, with contempt for the
littleness, the narrow outlook, that seemed to me to characterise every
written work. I was fiercely, but quite impotently, eager at such times
to demonstrate the futility of all the philosophy ranged on the rough
wooden shelves in my gloomy sitting-room. I would walk up and down and
gesticulate, struggling, fighting to make clear to myself what a true
philosophy should set forth. I felt at such times that all the
knowledge I needed for so stupendous a task was present with me in some
inexplicable way, was even pressing upon me, but that my brain was so
clogged and heavy that not one idea of all that priceless wisdom could
be expressed in clear thought. &ldquo;I have never been taught to
think,&rdquo; I would complain, &ldquo;I have never perfected the
machinery of thought,&rdquo; and then some dictum thrown out haphazard
by the Wonder&mdash;his conception of light conversation&mdash;would
recur to me, and I would realise that however well I had been trained,
my limitations would remain, that I was an undeveloped animal, only one
stage higher than a totem-fearing savage, a creature of small
possibilities, incapable of dealing with great problems.</p>
<p>Once the Wonder said to me, in a rare moment of lucid condescension
to my feeble intellect, &ldquo;You <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb253"
href="#pb253" name="pb253">253</a>]</span>figure space as a void in
three dimensions, and time as a line that runs across it, and all other
conceptions you relegate to that measure.&rdquo; He implied that this
was a cumbrous machinery which had no relation to reality, and could
define nothing. He told me that his idea of force, for example, was a
pure abstraction, for which there was no figure in my mental
outfit.</p>
<p>Such pronouncements as these left me struggling like a drowning man
in deep water. I felt that it <i>must</i> be possible for me to come to
the surface, but I could do nothing but flounder; beat fiercely with
limbs that were so powerful and yet so utterly useless. I saw that my
very metaphors symbolised my feebleness; I had no terms for my own
mental condition; I was forced to resort to some inapplicable physical
analogy.</p>
<p>These fits of revolt against the limitations of human thought grew
more frequent as the summer progressed. Day after day my
self-sufficiency and conceit were being crushed out of me. I was always
in the society of a boy of seven whom I was forced to regard as
immeasurably my intellectual superior. There was no department of
useful knowledge in which I could compete with him. Compete indeed! I
might as well speak of a third-standard child competing with Macaulay
in a general knowledge paper. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb254"
href="#pb254" name="pb254">254</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Useful</i> knowledge,&rdquo; I have written, but the
phrase needs definition. I might have taught the Wonder many things, no
doubt; the habits of men in great cities, the aspects of foreign
countries, or the subtleties of cricket; but when I was with him I
felt&mdash;and my feelings must have been typical&mdash;that such
things as these were of no account.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the summer, the occasions upon which I was able
to stimulate myself into a condition of bearable complacency were very
rare. I often thought of Challis&rsquo;s advice to leave the Wonder
alone. I should have gone away if I had been free, but Victor Stott had
a use for me, and I was powerless to disobey him. I feared him, but he
controlled me at his will. I feared him as I had once feared an
imaginary God, but I did not hate him.</p>
<p>One curious little fragment of wisdom came to me as the result of my
experience&mdash;a useless fragment perhaps, but something that has in
one way altered my opinion of my fellow-men. I have learnt that a
measure of self-pride, of complacency, is essential to every human
being. I judge no man any more for displaying an overweening vanity,
rather do I envy him this representative mark of his humanity. The
Wonder was completely and quite inimitably devoid of any conceit, and
the word ambition had no meaning for him. It was inconceivable that he
should compare himself with any of his fellow-creatures, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb255" href="#pb255" name="pb255">255</a>]</span>and
it was inconceivable that any honour they might have lavished upon him
would have given him one moment&rsquo;s pleasure. He was entirely alone
among aliens who were unable to comprehend him, aliens who could not
flatter him, whose opinions were valueless to him. He had no more
common ground on which to air his knowledge, no more grounds for
comparison by which to achieve self-conceit than a man might have in a
world tenanted only by sheep. From what I have heard him say on the
subject of our slavery to preconceptions, I think the metaphor of sheep
is one which he might have approved.</p>
<p>But the result of all this, so far as I am concerned, is a feeling
of admiration for those men who are capable of such magnificent
approval for themselves, the causes they espouse, their family, their
country, and their species; it is an approval which I fear I can never
again attain in full measure.</p>
<p>I have seen possibilities which have enforced a humbleness that is
not good for my happiness or conducive to my development. Henceforward
I will espouse the cause of vanity. It is only the vain who deprecate
vanity in others.</p>
<p>But there were times in the early period of my association with
Victor Stott when I rebelled vigorously against his complacent
assumption of my ignorance. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb256" href=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">May was a gloriously fine month, and we were much out
of doors. Unfortunately, except for one fortnight in August, that was
all the settled weather we had that summer.</p>
<p>I remember sitting one afternoon staring at the same pond that
Ginger Stott had stared at when he told me that the boy now beside me
was a &ldquo;blarsted freak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Wonder had said nothing that day, but now he began to enunciate
some of his incomprehensible commonplaces in that thin, clear voice of
his. I wrote down what I could remember of his utterances when I went
home, but now I read them over again I am exceedingly doubtful whether
I reported him correctly. There is, however, one dictum which seems
clearly phrased, and when I recall the scene, I remember trying to push
the induction he had started. The pronouncement, as I have it written,
is as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pure deduction from a single <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e4188" title="Source: premiss">premise</span>, unaided by previous
knowledge of the functions of the terms used in the expansion of the
argument, is an act of creation, incontrovertible, and outside the
scope of human reasoning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I believe he meant to say&mdash;but my notes are horribly
confused&mdash;that logic and philosophy were <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb257" href="#pb257" name="pb257">257</a>]</span>only
relative, being dependent always in a greater or less degree upon the
test of a material experiment for verification.</p>
<p>Here, as always, I find the Wonder&rsquo;s pronouncements very
elusive. In one sense I see that what I have quoted here is a
self-evident proposition, but I have the feeling that behind it there
lies some gleam of wisdom which throws a faint light on the profound
problem of existence.</p>
<p>I remember that in my own feeble way I tried to analyse this
statement, and for a time I thought I had grasped one significant
aspect of it. It seemed to me that the possibility of conceiving a
philosophy that was not dependent for verification upon material
experiment&mdash;that is to say, upon evidence afforded by the five
senses&mdash;indicates that there is something which is not matter; but
that since the development of such a philosophy is not possible to our
minds, we must argue that our dependence upon matter is so intimate
that it is almost impossible to conceive that we are actuated by any
impulse which does not arise out of a material complex.</p>
<p>At the back of my mind there seemed to be a thought that I could not
focus, I trembled on the verge of some great revelation that never
came.</p>
<p>Through my thoughts there ran a thread of reverence for the
intelligence that had started my <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb258"
href="#pb258" name="pb258">258</a>]</span>speculations. If only he
could speak in terms that I could understand.</p>
<p>I looked round at the Wonder. He was, as usual, apparently lost in
abstraction, and quite unconscious of my regard.</p>
<p>The wind was strong on the Common, and he sniffed once or twice and
then wiped his nose. He did not use a handkerchief.</p>
<p>It came to me at the moment that he was no more than a vulgar little
village boy.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There were few incidents to mark the progress of that
summer. I marked the course of time by my own thoughts and feelings,
especially by my growing submission to the control of the Wonder.</p>
<p>It was curious to recall that I had once thought of correcting the
Wonder&rsquo;s manners, of administering, perhaps, a smacking. That was
a fault of ignorance. I had often erred in the same way in other
experiences of life, but I had not taken the lesson to heart. I
remember at school our &ldquo;head&rdquo; taking us&mdash;I was in the
lower fifth then&mdash;in Latin verse. He rebuked me for a false
quantity, and I, very cocksure, disputed the point and read my line.
The head pointed out very gravely that I had been misled by an English
analogy in my pronunciation <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb259" href=
"#pb259" name="pb259">259</a>]</span>of the word &ldquo;maritus,&rdquo;
and I grew very hot and ashamed and apologetic. I feel much the same
now when I think of my early attitude towards the Wonder. But this
time, I think, I have profited by my experience.</p>
<p>There is, however, one incident which in the light of subsequent
events it seems worth while to record.</p>
<p>One afternoon in early July, when the sky had lifted sufficiently
for us to attempt some sort of a walk, we made our way down through the
sodden woods in the direction of Deane Hill.</p>
<p>As we were emerging into the lane at the foot of the slope, I saw
the Harrison idiot lurking behind the trunk of a big beech. This was
only the third time I had seen him since I drove him away from the
farm, and on the two previous occasions he had not come close to
us.</p>
<p>This time he had screwed up his courage to follow us. As we climbed
the lane I saw him slouching up the hedge-side behind us.</p>
<p>The Wonder took no notice, and we continued our way in silence.</p>
<p>When we reached the prospect at the end of the hill, where the
ground falls away like a cliff and you have a bird&rsquo;s-eye view of
two counties, we sat down on the steps of the monument erected in
honour of those Hampdenshire men whose lives were thrown away in the
South-African war. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb260" href="#pb260"
name="pb260">260</a>]</span></p>
<p>That view always has a soothing effect upon me, and I gave myself up
to an ecstasy of contemplation and forgot, for a few moments, the
presence of the Wonder, and the fact that the idiot had followed
us.</p>
<p>I was recalled to existence by the sound of a foolish, conciliatory
mumbling, and looked round to see the leering face of the Harrison
idiot ogling the Wonder from the corner of the plinth. The Wonder was
between me and the idiot, but he was apparently oblivious of either of
us.</p>
<p>I was about to rise and drive the idiot away, but the Wonder, still
staring out at some distant horizon, said quietly, &ldquo;Let him
be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was astonished, but I sat still and awaited events.</p>
<p>The idiot behaved much as I have seen a very young and nervous puppy
behave.</p>
<p>He came within a few feet of us, gurgling and crooning, flapping his
hands and waggling his great head; his uneasy eyes wandered from the
Wonder to me and back again, but it was plainly the Wonder whom he
wished to propitiate. Then he suddenly backed as if he had dared too
much, flopped on to the wet grass and regarded us both with foolish,
goggling eyes. For a few seconds he lay still, and then he began to
squirm along the ground towards us, a few inches at a time, stopping
every now and again to bleat and gurgle with that curious, crooning
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb261" href="#pb261" name=
"pb261">261</a>]</span>note which he appeared to think would pacificate
the object of his overtures.</p>
<p>I stood by, as it were, ready to obey the first hint that the
presence of this horrible creature was distasteful to the Wonder, but
he gave no sign.</p>
<p>The idiot had come within five or six feet of us, wriggling himself
along the wet grass, before the Wonder looked at him. The look when it
came was one of those deliberate, intentional stares which made one
feel so contemptible and insignificant.</p>
<p>The idiot evidently regarded this look as a sign of encouragement.
He knelt up, began to flap his hands and changed his crooning note to a
pleased, emphatic bleat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A-ba-ba,&rdquo; he blattered, and made uncouth gestures, by
which I think he meant to signify that he wanted the Wonder to come and
play with him.</p>
<p>Still the Wonder gave no sign, but his gaze never wavered, and
though the idiot was plainly not intimidated, he never met that gaze
for more than a second or two. Nevertheless he came on, walking now on
his knees, and at last stretched out a hand to touch the boy he so
curiously desired for a playmate.</p>
<p>That broke the spell. The Wonder drew back quickly&mdash;he never
allowed one to touch him&mdash;got up and climbed two or three steps
higher up the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb262" href="#pb262" name=
"pb262">262</a>]</span>base of the monument. &ldquo;Send him
away,&rdquo; he said to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; I said threateningly to the idiot,
and at the sound of my voice and the gesture of my hand, he blenched,
yelped, rolled over away from me, and then got to his feet and shambled
off for several yards before stopping to regard us once more with his
pacificatory, disgusting ogle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Send him away,&rdquo; repeated the Wonder, as I hesitated,
and I rose to my feet and pretended to pick up a stone.</p>
<p>That was enough. The idiot yelped again and made off. This time he
did not stop, though he looked over his shoulder several times as he
lolloped away among the low gorse, to which look I replied always with
the threat of an imaginary stone.</p>
<p>The Wonder made no comment on the incident as we walked home. He had
shown no sign of fear. It occurred to me that my guardianship of him
was merely a convenience, not a protection from any danger.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">As time went on it became increasingly clear to me
that my chance of obtaining the Wonder&rsquo;s confidence was becoming
more and more remote.</p>
<p>At first he had replied to my questions; usually, it is true, by no
more than an inclination of his head, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb263" href="#pb263" name="pb263">263</a>]</span>but he soon ceased to
make even this acknowledgment of my presence.</p>
<p>So I fell by degrees into a persistent habit of silence, admitted my
submission by obtruding neither remark nor question upon my constant
companion, and gave up my intention of using the Wonder as a means to
gratify my curiosity concerning the problem of existence.</p>
<p>Once or twice I saw Crashaw at a distance. He undoubtedly recognised
the Wonder, and I think he would have liked to come up and rebuke
him&mdash;perhaps me, also; but probably he lacked the courage. He
would hover within sight of us for a few minutes, scowling, and then
stalk away. He gave me the impression of being a dangerous man, a
thwarted fanatic, brooding over his defeat. If I had been Mrs. Stott, I
should have feared the intrusion of Crashaw more than the foolish
overtures of the Harrison idiot. But there was, of course, the
Wonder&rsquo;s compelling power to be reckoned with, in the case of
Crashaw.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Challis came back in early September, and it was he
who first coaxed, and then goaded me into rebellion.</p>
<p>Challis did not come too soon. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb264"
href="#pb264" name="pb264">264</a>]</span></p>
<p>At the end of August I was seeing visions, not pleasant, inspiriting
visions, but the indefinite, perplexing shapes of delirium.</p>
<p>I think it must have been in August that I stood on Deane Hill,
through an afternoon of fine, driving rain, and had a vision of myself
playing tricks with the sands of life.</p>
<p>I had begun to lose my hold on reality. Silence, contemplation, a
long-continued wrestle with the profound problems of life, were
combining to break up the intimacy of life and matter, and my brain was
not of the calibre to endure the strain.</p>
<p>Challis saw at once what ailed me.</p>
<p>He came up to the farm one morning at twelve o&rsquo;clock. The date
was, I believe, the twelfth of September. It was a brooding, heavy
morning, with half a gale of wind blowing from the south-west, but it
had not rained, and I was out with the Wonder when Challis arrived.</p>
<p>He waited for me and talked to the flattered Mrs. Berridge,
remonstrated kindly with her husband for his neglect of the farm, and
incidentally gave him a rebate on the rent.</p>
<p>When I came in, he insisted that I should come to lunch with him at
Challis Court.</p>
<p>I consented, but stipulated that I must be back at Pym by three
o&rsquo;clock to accompany the Wonder for his afternoon walk.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb265" href="#pb265" name=
"pb265">265</a>]</span></p>
<p>Challis looked at me curiously, but allowed the stipulation.</p>
<p>We hardly spoke as we walked down the hill&mdash;the habit of
silence had grown upon me, but after lunch Challis spoke out his
mind.</p>
<p>On that occasion I hardly listened to him, but he came up to the
farm again after tea and marched me off to dinner at the Court. I was
strangely plastic when commanded, but when he suggested that I should
give up my walks with the Wonder, go away&#8202;&hellip;. I smiled and
said &ldquo;Impossible,&rdquo; as though that ended the matter.</p>
<p>Challis, however, persisted, and I suppose I was not too far gone to
listen to him. I remember his saying: &ldquo;That problem is not for
you or me or any man living to solve by introspection. Our work is to
add knowledge little by little, data here and there, for future
evidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The phrase struck me, because the Wonder had once said &ldquo;There
are no data,&rdquo; when in the early days I had asked him whether he
could say definitely if there was any future existence possible for
us?</p>
<p>Now Challis put it to me that our work was to find data, that every
little item of real knowledge added to the feeble store man has
accumulated in his few thousand years of life, was a step, the greatest
step any man could possibly make. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb266"
href="#pb266" name="pb266">266</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;But could we not get, not a small but a very important item,
from Victor Stott?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Challis shook his head. &ldquo;He is too many thousands of years
ahead of us,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We can only bridge the gap by many
centuries of patient toil. If a revelation were made to us, we should
not understand it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, by degrees, Challis&rsquo;s influence took possession of me and
roused me to self-assertion.</p>
<p>One morning, half in dread, I stayed at home and read a
novel&mdash;no other reading could hold my attention&mdash;philosophy
had become nauseating.</p>
<p>I expected to see the strange little figure of the Wonder come
across the Common, but he never came, nor did I receive any reproach
from Ellen Mary. I think she had forgotten her fear of the Harrison
idiot.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I did not give up my guardianship all at once. Three
times after that morning I took the Wonder for a walk. He made no
allusion to my defalcations. Indeed he never spoke. He relinquished me
as he had taken me up, without comment or any expression of
feeling.</p>

put my things together and pack my books. I had decided to go to Cairo
for the winter with Challis.</p>
<p>At half-past one o&rsquo;clock on Thursday, the eighth of October, I
was in the sitting-room, when I saw the figure of Mrs. Stott coming
across the Common. She came with a little stumbling run. I could see

<p class="first">She opened the front door without knocking, and came
straight into my sitting-room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;E&rsquo;s not &rsquo;ere,&rdquo; she said in a manner
that left it doubtful whether she made an assertion or asked a
question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your son?&rdquo; I said. I had risen when she came into the
room<span class="corr" id="xd26e4362" title="Source: ,">.</span>
&ldquo;No; I haven&rsquo;t seen him to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ellen Mary was staring at me, but it was clear that she neither saw
nor heard me. She had a look of intense concentration. One could see
that she was calculating, thinking, thinking&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>I went over to her and took her by the arm. I gently shook her.
&ldquo;Now, tell me what&rsquo;s the matter? What has happened?&rdquo;
I asked.</p>
<p>She made an effort to collect herself, loosened her arm from my hold
and with an instinctive movement pushed forward the old bonnet, which
had slipped to the back of her head. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;E &rsquo;asn&rsquo;t been in to &rsquo;is

looking for &rsquo;im.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may have made a mistake in the time,&rdquo; I
suggested.</p>
<p>She made a movement as though to push me on one side, and turned
towards the door. She was calculating again. Her <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e4378" title="Source: expresion">expression</span> said quite
plainly, &ldquo;Could he be there, could he be <i>there</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;there is surely no need to
be anxious yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned on me. &ldquo;&rsquo;E never makes a mistake in the
time,&rdquo; she said fiercely, &ldquo;&rsquo;e always knows the time
to the minute without clock or watch. Why did you leave &rsquo;im
alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She broke off in her attack upon me and continued:
&ldquo;&rsquo;E&rsquo;s never been late before, not a minute, and now
it&rsquo;s a hour after &rsquo;is time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may be at home by now,&rdquo; I said. She took the hint
instantly and started back again with the same stumbling little
run.</p>
<p>I picked up my hat and followed her.</p>

<p class="first">The Wonder was not at the cottage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, my dear woman, you must keep calm,&rdquo; I said.
&ldquo;There is absolutely no reason to be disturbed. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb270" href="#pb270" name="pb270">270</a>]</span>You
had better go to Challis Court and see if he is in the library,
I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a fool,&rdquo; broke in Ellen Mary with sudden
decision, and she set off again without another word. I followed her
back to the Common and watched her out of sight. I was more disturbed
about her than about the non-appearance of the Wonder. He was well able
to take care of himself, but she&#8202;&hellip;. How strange that with
all her calculations she had not thought of going to Challis Court, to
the place where her son had spent so many days. I began to question
whether the whole affair was not, in some way, a mysterious creation of
her own disordered brain.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I took upon myself to carry out that part of the
programme which I had not been allowed to state in words to Mrs. Stott,
and set out for Deane Hill. It was just possible that the Wonder might
have slipped down that steep incline and injured himself. Possible, but
very unlikely; the Wonder did not take the risks common to boys of his
age, he did not disport himself on dangerous slopes.</p>
<p>As I walked I felt a sense of lightness, of relief from depression.
I had not been this way by myself since the end of August. It was good
to be alone and free.</p>
<p>The day was fine and not cold, though the sun was <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb271" href="#pb271" name=
"pb271">271</a>]</span>hidden. I noticed that the woods showed scarcely
a mark of autumn decline.</p>
<p>There was not a soul to be seen by the monument. I scrambled down
the slope and investigated the base of the hill and came back another
way through the woods. I saw no one. I stopped continually and whistled
loudly. If he is anywhere near at hand, I thought, and in trouble, he
will hear that and answer me. I did not call him by name. I did not
know what name to call. It would have seemed absurd to have called
&ldquo;Victor.&rdquo; No one ever addressed him by name.</p>
<p>My return route brought me back to the south edge of the Common, the
point most remote from the farm. There I met a labourer whom I knew by
sight, a man named Hawke. He was carrying a stick, and prodding with it
foolishly among the furze and gorse bushes. The bracken was already
dying down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you looking for?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s this &rsquo;ere Master Stott, sir,&rdquo; he said,
looking up. &ldquo;&rsquo;E&rsquo;s got loarst seemingly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I felt a sudden stab of self-reproach. I had been taking things too
easily. I looked at my watch. It was a quarter to four.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Challis &rsquo;ave told me to look for &rsquo;un,&rdquo;
added the man, and continued his aimless prodding of the gorse.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb272" href="#pb272" name=
"pb272">272</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Mr. Challis?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;E&rsquo;s yonder, soomewheres.&rdquo; He made a vague
gesture in the direction of Pym.</p>
<p>The sun had come out, and the Common was all aglow. I hastened
towards the village.</p>
<p>On the way I met Farmer Bates and two or three labourers. They, too,
were beating among the gorse and brown bracken. They told me that Mr.
Challis was at the cottage and I hurried on. All the neighbourhood, it
seems, were searching for the Wonder. In the village I saw three or
four women standing with aprons over their heads, talking together.</p>
<p>I had never seen Pym so animated.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">I met Challis in the lane. He was coming away from
Mrs. Stott&rsquo;s cottage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you found him?&rdquo; I asked stupidly. I knew quite
well that the Wonder was not found, and yet I had a fond hope that I
might, nevertheless, be mistaken.</p>
<p>Challis shook his head. &ldquo;There will be a mad woman in that
cottage if he doesn&rsquo;t come back by nightfall,&rdquo; he remarked
with a jerk of his head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done what I can for
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I explained that I had been over to Deane Hill, searching and
calling. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb273" href="#pb273" name=
"pb273">273</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t see anything?&rdquo; asked Challis, echoing
my foolish query of a moment before. I shook my head.</p>
<p>We were both agitated without doubt.</p>
<p>We soon came up with Farmer Bates and his men. They stopped and
touched their hats when they saw us, and we put the same silly question
to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t found him?&rdquo; We knew perfectly well
that they would have announced the fact at once if they had found
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of you go over to the Court and get any man you can find
to come and help,&rdquo; said Challis. &ldquo;Tell Heathcote to send
every one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the labourers touched his cap again, and started off at once
with a lumbering trot.</p>
<p>Challis and I walked on in silence, looking keenly about us and
stopping every now and then and calling. We called &ldquo;Hallo!
Hallo-o!&rdquo; It was an improvement upon my whistle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s such a little chap,&rdquo; muttered Challis once;
&ldquo;it would be so easy to miss him if he were
unconscious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It struck me that the reference to the Wonder was hardly
sufficiently respectful. I had never thought of him as &ldquo;a little
chap.&rdquo; But Challis had not known him so intimately as I had.</p>
<p>The shadows were fast creeping over the Common. At the woodside it
was already twilight. The whole <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb274"
href="#pb274" name="pb274">274</a>]</span>of the western sky right up
to the zenith was a finely shaded study in brilliant orange and yellow.
&ldquo;More rain,&rdquo; I thought instinctively, and paused for a
moment to watch the sunset. The black distance stood clearly
silhouetted against the sky. One could discern the sharp outline of
tiny trees on the distant horizon.</p>
<p>We met Heathcote and several other men in the lane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shan&rsquo;t be able to do much to-night, sir,&rdquo; said
Heathcote. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be dark in &rsquo;alf an hour,
sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, do what you can in half an hour,&rdquo; replied
Challis, and to me he said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better come back with
me. We&rsquo;ve done what we can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had a picture of him then as the magnate; I had hardly thought of
him in that light before. The arduous work of the search he could
delegate to his inferiors. Still, he had come out himself, and I doubt
not that he had been altogether charming to the bewildered, distraught
mother.</p>
<p>I acquiesced in his suggestion. I was beginning to feel very
tired.</p>
<p>Mrs. Heathcote was at the gate when we arrived at the Court.
&ldquo;&rsquo;Ave they found &rsquo;im, sir?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; replied Challis.</p>
<p>I followed him into the house. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb275"

<p class="first">As I walked back at ten o&rsquo;clock it was raining
steadily. I had refused the offer of a trap. I went through the dark
and sodden wood, and I lingered and listened. The persistent tap, tap,
tap of the rain on the leaves irritated me. How could one hear while
that noise was going on? There was no other sound. There was not a
breath of wind. Only that perpetual tap, tap, tap, patter, patter,
drip, tap, tap. It seemed as if it might go on through
eternity&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>I went to the Stotts&rsquo; cottage, though I knew there could be no
news. Challis had given strict instructions that any news should be
brought to him immediately. If it was bad news it was to be brought to
him before the mother was told.</p>
<p>There was a light burning in the cottage, and the door was set wide
open.</p>
<p>I went up to the door but I did not go in.</p>
<p>Ellen Mary was sitting in a high chair, her hands clasped together,
and she rocked continually to and fro. She made no sound; she merely
rocked herself with a steady, regular persistence.</p>
<p>She did not see me standing at the open door, and I moved quietly
away.</p>
<p>As I walked over the Common&mdash;I avoided the wood
deliberately&mdash;I wondered what was the human <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb276" href="#pb276" name=
"pb276">276</a>]</span>limit of endurance. I wondered whether Ellen
Mary had not reached that limit.</p>
<p>Mrs. Berridge had not gone to bed, and there were some visitors in
the kitchen. I heard them talking. Mrs. Berridge came out when I opened
the front door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any news, sir?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; no news,&rdquo; I said. I had been about to ask her the
same question.</p>

<p class="first">I did not go to sleep for some time. I had a picture
of Ellen Mary before my eyes, and I could still hear that steady pat,
patter, drip, of the rain on the beech leaves.</p>
<p>In the night I awoke suddenly, and thought I heard a long, wailing
cry out on the Common. I got up and looked out of the window, but I
could see nothing. The rain was still falling, but there was a blur of
light that showed where the moon was shining behind the clouds. The
cry, if there had been a cry, was not repeated.</p>
<p>I went back to bed and soon fell asleep again.</p>
<p>I do not know whether I had been dreaming, but I woke suddenly with
a presentation of the little pond on the Common very clear before me.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb277" href="#pb277" name=

<p>&ldquo;We never looked in the pond,&rdquo; I thought, and
then&mdash;&ldquo;but he could not have fallen into the pond; besides,
it&rsquo;s not two feet deep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was full daylight, and I got up and found that it was nearly
seven o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>The rain had stopped, but there was a scurry of low, threatening
cloud that blew up from the south.</p>
<p>I dressed at once and went out. I made my way directly to the
Stotts&rsquo; cottage.</p>
<p>The lamp was still burning and the door open, but Ellen Mary had
fallen forward on to the table; her head was pillowed on her arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There <i>is</i> a limit to our endurance,&rdquo; I reflected,
&ldquo;and she has reached it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I left her undisturbed.</p>
<p>Outside I met two of Farmer Bates&rsquo;s labourers going back to
work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to come up with me to the pond,&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p class="first">The pond was very full.</p>
<p>On the side from which we approached, the ground sloped gradually,
and the water was stretching out far beyond its accustomed limits.</p>
<p>On the farther side the gorse among the trunks of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb278" href="#pb278" name="pb278">278</a>]</span>the
three ash-trees came right to the edge of the bank. On that side the
bank was three or four feet high.</p>
<p>We came to the edge of the pond, and one of the labourers waded in a
little way&mdash;the water was very shallow on that side&mdash;but we
could see nothing for the scum of weed, little spangles of dirty green,
and a mass of some other plant that had borne a little white flower in
the earlier part of the year&mdash;stuff like dwarf hemlock.</p>
<p>Under the farther bank, however, I saw one comparatively clear space
of black water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go round,&rdquo; I said, and led the way.</p>
<p>There was a tiny path which twisted between the gorse roots and came
out at the edge of the farther bank by the stem of the tallest ash. I
had seen tiny village boys pretending to fish from this point with a
stick and a piece of string. There was a dead branch of ash some five
or six feet long, with the twigs partly twisted off; it was lying among
the bushes. I remembered that I had seen small boys using this branch
to clear away the surface weed. I picked it up and took it with me.</p>
<p>I wound one arm round the trunk of the ash, and peered over into the
water under the bank.</p>
<p>I caught sight of something white under the water. I could not see
distinctly. I thought it was a piece of broken ware&mdash;the bottom of
a basin. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb279" href="#pb279" name=
"pb279">279</a>]</span>I had picked up the ash stick and was going to
probe the deeper water with it. Then I saw that the dim white object
was globular.</p>
<p>The end of my stick was actually in the water. I withdrew it
quickly, and threw it behind me.</p>
<p>My heart began to throb painfully.</p>
<p>I turned my face away and leaned against the ash-tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you see anythin&rsquo;?&rdquo; asked one of the labourers
who had come up behind me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Christ!&rdquo; I said. I turned quickly from the pond and
pressed a way through the gorse.</p>
<p>I was overwhelmingly and disgustingly sick.</p>

<p>My clothes were wet and muddy where I had lain on the sodden ground.
I got to my feet and instinctively began to brush at the mud.</p>
<p>I was still a little giddy, and I swayed and sought for support.</p>
<p>I could see the back of one labourer. He was kneeling by the
ash-tree bending right down over the water. The other man was standing
in the pond, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb280" href="#pb280" name=

The lamp was fluttering to extinction, the flame leaping spasmodically,
dying down till it seemed that it had gone out, and then again suddenly
flickering up with little clicking bursts of flame. The air reeked
intolerably of paraffin.</p>
<p>I blew the lamp out and pushed it on one side.</p>
<p>There was no need to break the news to Ellen Mary. She had known
last night, and now she was beyond the reach of information.</p>
<p>She sat upright in her chair and stared out into the immensity. Her
hands alone moved, and they were not still for an instant. They lay in
her lap, and her fingers writhed and picked at her dress.</p>
<p>I spoke to her once, but I knew that her mind was beyond the reach
of my words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is just as well,&rdquo; I thought; &ldquo;but we must get
her away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I went out and called to the woman next door.</p>
<p>She was in her kitchen, but the door was open. She came out when I
knocked.</p>

could not move. I felt sick again, and utterly weak and powerless, and
I could not take my gaze from that little doll with the great drooping
head that rolled as the men walked.</p>
<p>I was reminded, disgustingly, of children with a guy.</p>
<p>The idiot ran shambling down the lane. He knew the two men, who

he must have realised in his poor, bemused brain that the thing was

lane towards me. He fell on his face a few yards from me, scrambled
wildly to his feet again and came on yelping and shrieking. He was
wildly, horribly afraid. I caught sight of his face as he passed me,
and his mouth was distorted into a square, his upper lip horribly drawn
up over his ragged, yellow teeth. Suddenly he dashed at the hedge and

<p class="first">The jury returned a verdict of &ldquo;Accidental
death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If there had been any traces of a struggle, I had not noticed them
when I came to the edge of the pond. There may have been marks as if a
foot had slipped. I was not thinking of evidence when I looked into the
water.</p>
<p>There were marks enough when the police came to investigate, but
they were the marks made by a twelve-stone man in hobnail boots, who
had scrambled into, and out of, the pond. As the inspector said, it was
not worth while wasting any time in looking for earlier traces of
footsteps below those marks.</p>
<p>Nor were there any signs of violence on the body. It was in no way
disfigured, save by the action of the water, in which it had lain for
eighteen hours.</p>
<p>There was, indeed, only one point of any significance <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb284" href="#pb284" name="pb284">284</a>]</span>from
the jury&rsquo;s point of view, and that they put on one side, if they
considered it at all; the body was pressed into the mud.</p>
<p>The Coroner asked a few questions about this fact.</p>
<p>Was the mud very soft? Yes, very soft, liquid on top.</p>
<p>How was the body lying? Face downwards.</p>
<p>What part of the body was deepest in the mud? The chest. The witness
said he had hard work to get the upper part of the body released; the
head was free, but the mud held the rest. &ldquo;The mooad soocked
like,&rdquo; was the expressive phrase of the witness.</p>
<p>The Coroner passed on to other things. Had any one a spite against
the child? and such futilities. Only once more did he revert to that
solitary significant fact. &ldquo;Would it be possible,&rdquo; he asked
of the abashed and self-conscious labourer, &ldquo;would it be possible
for the body to have worked its way down into the soft mud as you have
described it to have been found?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We-el,&rdquo; said the witness, &ldquo;&rsquo;twas in the
stacky mooad, &rsquo;twas through the sarft stoof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this soft mud would suck any solid body down, would it
not?&rdquo; persisted the Coroner.</p>
<p>And the witness recalled the case of a duck that had been sucked
into the same soft pond mud the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb285"
href="#pb285" name="pb285">285</a>]</span>summer before, and cited the
instance. He forgot to add that on that occasion the mud had not been
under water.</p>
<p>The Coroner accepted the instance. There can be no question that
both he and the jury were anxious to accept the easier explanation.</p>

<p class="first">But I know perfectly well that the Wonder did not fall
into the pond by accident.</p>
<p>I should have known, even if that conclusive evidence with regard to
his being pushed into the mud had never come to light.</p>
<p>He may have stood by the ash-tree and looked into the water, but he
would never have fallen. He was too perfectly controlled; and, with all
his apparent abstraction, no one was ever more alive to the detail of
his surroundings. He and I have walked together perforce in many
slippery places, but I have never known him to fall or even begin to
lose his balance, whereas I have gone down many times.</p>
<p>Yes; I know that he was pushed into the pond, and I know that he was
held down in the mud, most probably by the aid of that ash stick I had
held. But it was not for me to throw suspicion on any one at that
inquest, and I preferred to keep my <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

inferences to myself. I should have done so, even if I had been in
possession of stronger evidence.</p>
<p>I hope that it was the Harrison idiot who was to blame. He was not
dangerous in the ordinary sense, but he might quite well have done the
thing in play&mdash;as he understood it. Only I cannot quite understand
his pushing the body down after it fell. That seems to argue
vindictiveness&mdash;and a logic which I can hardly attribute to the
idiot. Still, who can tell what went on in the distorted mind of that
poor creature? He is reported to have rescued the dead body of a rabbit
from the undergrowth on one occasion, and to have blubbered when he
could not bring it back to life.</p>
<p>There is but one other person who could have been implicated, and I
hesitate to name him in this place. Yet one remembers what terrific
acts of misapplied courage and ferocious brutality the fanatics of
history have been capable of performing when their creed and their
authority have been set at naught.</p>

<h2 class="main">EPILOGUE</h2>
<h2 class="main">THE USES OF MYSTERY</h2>
<p class="first">Something Challis has told me; something I have
learned for myself; and there is something which has come to me from an
unknown source.</p>
<p>But here again we are confronted with the original
difficulty&mdash;the difficulty that for some conceptions there is no
verbal figure.</p>
<p>It is comprehensible, it is, indeed, obvious that the deeper
abstract speculation of the Wonder&rsquo;s thought cannot be set out by
any metaphor that would be understood by a lesser intelligence.</p>
<p>We see that many philosophers, whose utterances have been recorded
in human history&mdash;that record which floats like a drop of oil on
the limitless ocean of eternity&mdash;have been confronted with this
same difficulty, and have woven an intricate and tedious design of
words in their attempt to convey some single conception&mdash;some
conception which themselves could see but dimly when disguised in the
masquerade of language; some figure that as it was <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb290" href="#pb290" name=
"pb290">290</a>]</span>limned grew ever more confused beneath the
wrappings of metaphor, so that we who read can glimpse scarce a hint of
its original shape and likeness. We see, also, that the very
philosophers who caricatured their own eidolon, became intrigued with
the logical abstraction of words and were led away into a wilderness of
barren deduction&mdash;their one inspired vision of a stable premiss
distorted and at last forgotten.</p>
<p>How then shall we hope to find words to adumbrate a philosophy which
starts by the assumption that we can have no impression of reality
until we have rid ourselves of the interposing and utterly false
concepts of space and time, which delimit the whole world of human
thought.</p>
<p>I admit that one cannot even begin to do this thing; within our
present limitations our whole machinery of thought is built of these
two original concepts. They are the only gauges wherewith we may
measure every reality, every abstraction; wherewith we may give outline
to any image or process of the mind. Only when we endeavour to grapple
with that indeterminable mystery of consciousness can we conceive,
however dimly, some idea of a pure abstraction uninfluenced by and
independent of, those twin bases of our means of thought.</p>
<p>Here it is that Challis has paused. Here he says <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb291" href="#pb291" name="pb291">291</a>]</span>that
we must wait, that no revelation can reveal what we are incapable of
understanding, that only by the slow process of evolution can we attain
to any understanding of the mystery we have sought to solve by our
futile and primitive hypotheses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But then,&rdquo; I have pressed him, &ldquo;why do you
hesitate to speak of what you heard on that afternoon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And once he answered me:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I glimpsed a finality,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and that
appalled me. Don&rsquo;t you see that ignorance is the means of our
intellectual pleasure? It is the solving of the problem that brings
enjoyment&mdash;the solved problem has no further interest. So when all
is known, the stimulus for action ceases; when all is known there is
quiescence, nothingness. Perfect knowledge implies the peace of death,
implies the state of being one&mdash;our pleasures are derived from
action, from differences, from heterogeneity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! pity the child,&rdquo; said Challis, &ldquo;for whom
there could be no mystery. Is not mystery the first and greatest joy of
life? Beyond the gate there is unexplored mystery for us in our
childhood. When that is explored, there are new and wonderful
possibilities beyond the hills, then beyond the seas, beyond the known
world, in the everyday chances and movements of the unknown life in
which we are circumstanced. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb292" href=
"#pb292" name="pb292">292</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely we should all perish through sheer inanity, or die
desperately by suicide if no mystery remained in the world. Mystery
takes a thousand beautiful shapes; it lurks even in the handiwork of
man, in a stone god, or in some mighty, intricate machine,
incomprehensibly deliberate and determined. The imagination endows the
man-made thing with consciousness and powers, whether of reservation or
aloofness; the similitude of meditation and profundity is wrought into
stone. Is there not source for mystery to the uninstructed in the great
machine registering the progress of its own achievement with each
solemn, recurrent beat of its metal pulse?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behind all these things is the wonder of the imagination that
never approaches more nearly to the creation of a hitherto unknown
image than when it thus hesitates on the verge of mystery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is yet so much, so very much cause for wondering
speculation. Science gains ground so slowly. Slowly it has outlined,
however vaguely, the uncertainties of our origin so far as this world
is concerned, while the mystic has fought for his entrancing fairy
tales one by one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mystic still holds his enthralling belief in the
succession of peoples who have risen and died&mdash;the succeeding
world-races, red, black, yellow, and white, which have in turn
dominated this planet. Science <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb293"
href="#pb293" name="pb293">293</a>]</span>with its hammer and chisel
may lay bare evidence, may collate material, date man&rsquo;s
appearance, call him the most recent of placental mammals, trace his
superstitions and his first conceptions of a god from the elemental
fears of the savage. But the mystic turns aside with an assumption of
superior knowledge; he waves away objective evidence; he has a
certainty impressed upon his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mystic is a power; he compels a multitude of followers,
because he offers an attraction greater than the facts of science; he
tells of a mystery profounder than any problem solved by patient
investigation, because his mystery is incomprehensible even by himself;
and in fear lest any should comprehend it, he disguises the approach
with an array of lesser mysteries, man-made; with terminologies,
symbologies and high talk of esotericism too fearful for any save the
initiate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we must preserve our mystic in some form against the
awful time when science shall have determined a limit; when the long
history of evolution shall be written in full, and every stage of
world-building shall be made plain. When the cycle of atomic dust to
atomic dust is demonstrated, and the detail of the life-process is
taught and understood, we shall have a fierce need for the mystic to
save us from the futility of a world we understand, to lie to us if
need be, to inspirit our material and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb294" href="#pb294" name="pb294">294</a>]</span>regular minds with
some breath of delicious madness. We shall need the mystic then, or the
completeness of our knowledge will drive us at last to complete the
dusty circle in our eagerness to escape from a world we
understand&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See how man clings to his old and useless traditions; see how
he opposes at every step the awful force of progress. At each stage he
protests that the thing that is, is good, or that the thing that was
and has gone, was better. He despises new knowledge and fondly clings
to the belief that once men were greater than they now are. He looks
back to the more primitive, and endows it with that mystery he cannot
find in his own times. So have men ever looked lingeringly behind them.
It is an instinct, a great and wonderful inheritance that postpones the
moment of disillusionment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are still mercifully surrounded with the countless
mysteries of every-day experience, all the evidences of the
unimaginable stimulus we call life. Would you take them away? Would you
resolve life into a disease of the ether&mdash;a disease of which you
and I, all life and all matter, are symptoms? Would you teach that to
the child, and explain to him that the wonder of life and growth is no
wonder, but a demonstrable result of impeded force, to be evaluated by
the application of an adequate formula? <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb295" href="#pb295" name="pb295">295</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;You and I,&rdquo; said Challis, &ldquo;are children in the
infancy of the world. Let us to our play in the nursery of our own
times. The day will come, perhaps, when humanity shall have grown and
will have to take upon itself the heavy burden of knowledge. But you
need not fear that that will be in our day, nor in a thousand
years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meanwhile leave us our childish fancies, our little
imaginings, our hope&mdash;children that we are&mdash;of those
impossible mysteries beyond the hills &hellip; beyond the hills.&rdquo;
