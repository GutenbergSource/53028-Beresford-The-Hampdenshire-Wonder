| Description | This book is an early Science Fiction classic, which centers about a child which develops super-human capabilities. Published in 1911, it was probably the first novel to deal with the sociological implications of a vastly superior human in our society. The setting is very British and the attitudes of the characters breath the Edwardian time. |
